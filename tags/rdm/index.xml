&lt;p&gt;This guide will cover some Endwalker Red Mage optimization concepts and principles that arenâ€™t fully covered in the basic job guide. The intended audience includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Mage players who have the fundamentals mostly down and are familiar with all the concepts in the &lt;a href="https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/"&gt;basic job guide&lt;/a&gt;, but are trying to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performing Red Mage players who get good logs through good GCD uptime, intuitive sense and repetition but wish to augment their theoretical understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players who have experience optimizing other jobs but are trying out Red Mage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the content here will cover concepts that are obvious to people who have experience playing other jobs at a high level. Other aspects will be unique to Red Mage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
