On November 19th - Early Access of Endwalker, many players may be interested in leveling either Reaper or Sage as their first job in the new expansion. This guide provides info on what to prepare and how to optimize your time to level from 70 to 80 as quick as possible.
EXP Sources to Prepare Before Endwalker is Released: Wondrous Tails (roughly 50%): Pick up Wondrous Tails in Idyllshire on the week of Tuesday, November 9th. Complete nine seals but DO NOT turn it in. Make sure you have nine Second Chance points as well. The Hunt (roughly 33%): Pick up daily One-Star / Two-Star / Three-Star Veteran Clan Mark Bills from Crystarium / Eulmore. These can be picked up whenever since they do not expire. If playing a new job with someone else also playing a new job, you can coordinate and sync your first set of One-Star / Two-Star / Three-Star logs by checking daily the new Hunt Logs (there are only about 8-10 different combinations of hunt monsters for each hunt log level). You can also create a map for the path you want to travel to kill them all using a tool such as FFXIVHuntPaths. You can also prep the logs by killing all but one of the number of monsters you need to kill for each log prior to the release of Endwalker.
If doing this, be careful not to accidentally pull more mobs than you need, and to be one short. I would strongly recommend you don’t participate in Shadowbringers Hunts once they are prepared, as some stray monsters can sometimes be tagged by party members which happen to be a monster needed for the Hunt Log. Challenge Logs (Depends on which ones you do, but roughly 30% total): Prepare Challenge Logs (i.e. Prepare 2/3 dungeons via Duty Roulette, 4/5 dungeons, 4/5 player commendations, complete 4/5 FATEs). These can be prepared starting Tuesday, November 16th. It is recommended to complete four FATEs in open world zones, queue for two dungeons via Duty Roulette (while commending people), then Normal Raid / Trial to give two more commendations, and complete two undersized dungeons to get to 4/5 dungeons so the first dungeon you queue will give you several Challenge Log bonuses and first FATE you do will give you a Challenge Log bonus on Friday, November 19th. Bloodsworn Pixie Beast Tribe (roughly 30%): While you will be unable to prepare a set to turn in ahead of time, being higher ranked gives you more EXP per quest so you should start ranking up now if you have not already. Bloodsworn takes 30 days worth of daily beast tribe quests to obtain from just starting the Pixie Beast Tribe. Menphina’s Earring (30% bonus EXP): Use the Menphina Earrings (Endwalker pre-order reward), which gives +30% extra experience up to level 80. The Heat of Battle (10% [II]/15% [III] bonus combat EXP): Make sure you have Heat of Battle III buffs prepared. If your FC does not have them, you can acquire them through the GC Squadron system. Leveling Food (3% bonus combat EXP): Any food will do! Ideally you will be using Shadowbringers food, as it has 10% VIT. (Smoked Chicken is the recommended food for both level 70 Reaper and Sage). Gear Sources to Prepare Before Endwalker is Released: Ensure you are capped on Poetics, Allegory, and Revelation so you can buy level 70 Tomestone weapon from Rhalgr’s Reach (Augmented weapon is 600 Poetics). Allegory and Revelation will become obsolete when 6.0 launches, but they can be traded in for Poetics."><meta itemprop=wordCount content="2198"><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/guide/guide-to-leveling-reaper-and-sage-immediately-in-endwalker/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Balance Guides"><meta property="og:title" content="Guide to Leveling Reaper and Sage Immediately in Endwalker"><meta property="og:description" content="Written by: Ringabel Dim (DNC Mentor in The Balance)

If “Dungeons (Lv. 71-79)” is featured as a Duty to complete, you can complete that as you queue for the Shadowbringers leveling dungeons and then you can use your Wondrous Tails second chance points to retry that specific type of Duty. Before doing this, you should clear any and all easily soloable / quickly clearable with a light party Extreme Trials (especially the ARR Extreme Trials). NOTE: You don’t have to be on Reaper/Sage when you are doing the Wondrous Tails duties, just be careful of your challenge logs if you are doing a Dungeon Duty.</li><li>If the Duties in your new Wondrous Tails book look like they’ll be too out of the way or too time consuming, don’t sweat completing it and instead just focus on either dungeon queueing or Bozja grinding.</li></ul><h1 id=bozjan-alternative-no-queues-or-pre-made-group>Bozjan Alternative (No Queues or Pre-Made Group):</h1><ul><li><p>If you are not interested in waiting for dungeon queues and farming FATEs, you can also do The Bozjan Southern Front or Zadnor zones. It may be more efficient to switch to Bozja once you have completed all of the Hunt Bills and Pixie Beast Tribes and done at the very least Duty Roulette: Leveling and Duty Roulette: Frontline.</p></li><li><p>These zones have the added benefit of not consuming rested EXP, allowing you to save it for the Endwalker MSQ.</p></li><li><p>You can queue for either The Bozjan Southern Front OR Zadnor since they both will give the same amount of character experience for different sections of the zone per this chart (NOTE: actual experience numbers are based off of old Shadowbringers EXP values and will be different in Endwalker).

These percentages were included in the experience rate estimates.</li><li>Estimates in terms of rate of Experience can also be affected by what percent of the time you are actively participating in a Critical Engagement vs. Skirmishes.</li></ul><p>Estimate experience rates for both these methods was calculated using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q8wdoFZQygE9YbO9qKo5d3L4Md1v8WjHDwXMkJk4ZDw/edit?usp=sharing">this experience rate calculator</a>.
