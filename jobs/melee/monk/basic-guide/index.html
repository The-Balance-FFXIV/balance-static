This is significant if you are still leveling, as some skills start out with a different name and upgrade upon reaching a certain level.

Uptime itself is a multifaceted word; firstly, it refers to how physically close you are to an enemy. You can&rsquo;t punch that which you are far away from, and as such always keep in mind that you want to be as close as possible for as long as possible. Of course, if you have to step away to do a mechanic or dodge an aoe do so, but the mind of a Monk should always be looking to <em>minimize</em> the amount of time we spend not-hitting something; whether that&rsquo;s not running so far away to do aforementioned mechanics, or running back to the boss sooner after aoe damage snapshots, it is something to always be working on.</p><p>Secondly, uptime refers to the amount of time you spend hitting the boss. It&rsquo;s great if you can stay within striking distance of your foe permanently, but if you aren&rsquo;t pressing buttons, you&rsquo;re not doing any damage. Don&rsquo;t fret too much about only wanting to press the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; buttons for your rotation; pressing something is better than pressing nothing. You have plenty of time to review mistakes and correct yourself on what you <em>should&rsquo;ve</em> done after the fact, the key is to make sure you&rsquo;re always doing <em>something.</em></p><p>Of course uptime isn&rsquo;t exclusively important to Monk, but it <em>is</em> a key aspect to being a <em>good</em> Monk, and so it&rsquo;s important to keep these principles in mind as you&rsquo;re learning; after all, as the job with the fastest GCD in the game, each second wasted not casting is comparably more valuable to a Monk than to another job.</p><h2 id=positionals>Positionals</h2><p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ve made the decision to play Monk while remaining unaware of the P-word, but in case you&rsquo;ve not come across it before, a &ldquo;positional&rdquo; is a skill that only gains maximum effect when used at a specific part of an enemy&rsquo;s hitbox: in Monk&rsquo;s case, either flank or rear. Alas, where we once had six positionals, in Endwalker we&rsquo;ve been reduced to having simply two:</p><ul><li><strong>Demolish</strong> deals maximum damage when executed from behind an enemy.</li><li><strong>Pouncing Coeurl</strong>, on the other hand, is best used from an enemy&rsquo;s flank (side).</li></ul><p>Missing either positional is a 60 potency loss, which will add up over a fight. Try to ensure you&rsquo;re never missing any positionals.</p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[162 484 109 463 80 387]" src=https://i.imgur.com/DBLRYTX.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt title="Combat Dummy - Positional Indicator"></div></p><p>The arrow on the top indicates the target&rsquo;s front. The the two arrows either side are another indication of where a target is facing, as well as defining the left and right of a boss. The entire section at the back where the double line ends counts as the &ldquo;rear&rdquo;, whereas the double lines either side count as the &ldquo;flank&rdquo;. As such, you are able to stand at the intercardinal of a hitbox and take just a step to the left/right to adjust for your positionals, as opposed to having to run all the way from directly rear to directly left, for example.</p><p>In some instances you will encounter a hitbox that is a completely closed circle. These enemies are omnipositional, meaning you will always get the positional bonus regardless of where you are.</p><h2 id=the-form-system>The Form System</h2><p>Forms are a concept unique to Monk, and are what separates it from standard combo-based melee jobs. Unlike other jobs that simply have combos that trigger each other in a static manner, you can combo any GCD into any other GCD - providing that you&rsquo;re progressing your form forward. Each GCD also enhanced when used in the correct form, meaning you want to keep your forms advancing forward and not break your combo, else you&rsquo;ll drop your form and your damage will suffer.</p><p>You progress through the three forms Opo-opo, Raptor and Coeurl one at a time, looping back around to Opo-opo after Coeurl:</p><ul><li>In Opo-Opo form, Leaping Opo, Dragon Kick, and Shadow of the Destroyer are enhanced. Using an Opo-opo GCD grants you Raptor form.</li><li>In Raptor form, Rising Raptor, Twin Snakes, and Four-point Fury are enhanced and usable. Using a Raptor GCD grants you Coeurl form.</li><li>In Coeurl form, Pouncing Coeurl, Demolish, and Rockbreaker are enhanced and usable. Using a Coeurl GCD grants you Opo-opo form.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=core-gcds>Core GCDs</h2><p>As previously mentioned, Monk has six core single-target GCDs.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div class=md__image><img id="[451 491 443 131 127 76]" src=https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002528_hr1.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt="Dragon Kick"></div></td><td><strong>Dragon Kick</strong> has a potency of 320.

Now, we know that we&rsquo;re going to be doing a three-step combo, but that we have two options for GCDs at each step; how do we decide which one to press?</p><p>Effectively, each step of our rotation has a Filler and a Spender option. <strong>Dragon Kick</strong>, <strong>Twin Snakes</strong> and <strong>Demolish</strong> gain you Fury, these fill the respective job gauge to full, thus Filler. <strong>Leaping Opo</strong>, <strong>Rising Raptor</strong> and <strong>Pouncing Coeurl</strong> will spend the Fury from the respective job gauge, thus Spender.</p><p>At each step, consult your job gauge, is there a Fury ball for your current form? Press the Spender GCD. Is it empty? Press the Filler GCD.

Early weaving, the inverse of late weaving, is pressing an oGCD as soon as possible following the previous GCD.</p><p>Of course, as a raid buff we are also aiming to keep Brotherhood in sync with our groups buffs as closely as possible, which is done by keeping it on cooldown and minimising any potential drift.</p><p>Using <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong> also grants us one use of <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> during its duration which should never be left unused. As <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> grants us <strong>Formless Fist</strong>, we are aiming to sandwhich it between Opo-opo GCD&rsquo;s - that is, to always use it after an Opo-opo GCD (<strong>Leaping Opo</strong> or <strong>Dragon Kick</strong>), and to always follow it up with another Opo-opo GCD.</p><h3 id=odd-and-even-windows>Odd and Even Windows</h3><p><strong>Riddle of Fire</strong> has a cooldown of 60 seconds, where <strong>Brotherhood</strong> sits at 120 seconds. This results with us pressing <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong> every minute, where ever other minute it will be paired with <strong>Brotherhood</strong>. Given that half of our burst windows consist solely of <strong>RoF</strong> and the other half have both <strong>RoF</strong> and <strong>BH</strong>, we have names to distinguish between them: <strong>even</strong> and <strong>odd</strong> windows.</p><p>The windows are named after the minute they occur in an encounter. <strong>RoF</strong> and <strong>BH</strong> are used together at the start of the fight and then align every 2 minutes (0, 2, 4, 6&mldr;), hence even window. <strong>RoF</strong> is used on its own every minute after even windows (1, 3, 5, 7, &mldr;), hence odd window.</p><p>As all raid buffs in the game - including our very own <strong>BH</strong> - have a cooldown of 2 minutes, we prioritise this window over the odd window. With the cooldown of <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> being 40 seconds, this allows to fit the following GCDs into each window:</p><ul><li>Even: 2x <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong>, 1x <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong></li><li>Odd: 1x <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong>, 1x <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong></li><li><strong>Wind&rsquo;s Reply</strong> should also be used in both windows, whenever <strong>Riddle of Wind</strong> aligns.</li></ul><h3 id=riddle-of-wind-and-winds-reply>Riddle of Wind and Wind&rsquo;s Reply</h3><p>As mentioned, <strong>Riddle of Wind</strong> being on a cooldown of 90 seconds means that it will only align with a <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong> every other use if used on cooldown (every 3 minutes). Using <strong>RoW</strong> will allow us to use <strong>Wind&rsquo;s Reply</strong> once during its duration. This naturally means that just as <strong>RoW</strong>, <strong>Wind&rsquo;s Reply</strong> also does not always align with every <strong>RoF</strong> window.</p><p>While using <strong>Riddle of Wind</strong> on cooldown guarantees the maximum usages, sometimes we can strategically delay <strong>RoW</strong> to make it align with <strong>RoF</strong>, we do this only if it does not lose us an overall usage. This again requires knowledge or a good guess of the kill time, if it is unknown, <strong>Riddle of Wind</strong> is best used on cooldown.</p><p>As an example, take a hypothetical encounter with a duration of 4 minutes and 30 seconds.</p><p>Pressing Riddle of Wind on cooldown would result in a total of 3 uses; 00:00, 01:30, 03:00. This sees one RoW in the opener, and one in an odd window.</p><p>However, we could instead use it at 00:00, 02:00, and 03:30. This is still 3 total uses, but we&rsquo;ve shifted a use out of the odd window and into the even window.</p><p>Where <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> is restricted in where it can be placed due to granting <strong>Formless Fist</strong>, <strong>Wind&rsquo;s Reply</strong> can be used freely within the duration of Wind&rsquo;s Rumination instead, being able to be placed absolutely anywhere within the 15 second window.</p><h3 id=perfect-balance-and-opo-opo-optimisation>Perfect Balance and Opo-opo Optimisation</h3><p><strong>Perfect Balance</strong> allows us to use GCDs of any of the 3 forms and using the resulting <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> grants us <strong>Formless Fist</strong>. As mentioned previously, Opo-opo GCDs are our strongest regular GCDs, as such we are looking to optimize the use of <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> to maximize our Opo-opo GCDs.</p><p>First and foremost we do this by placement of <strong>Perfect Balance</strong>. Ideally it should always be placed after and follow an Opo-opo GCD.</p><p>Secondly is sequencing. When using <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> to execute an <strong>Elixir Burst</strong> or a <strong>Phantom Rush</strong>, we are exclusively using Opo-opo GCDs. When building a <strong>Rising Phoenix</strong>, we are forced to use one GCD of each form. It might not be immediately obvious, but the order of those GCDs do matter.</p><p>A very common optimisation we can make for the Solar <strong>PB</strong> sequence for <strong>Rising Phoenix</strong> is pressing <strong>PB</strong> slightly before <strong>RoF</strong> following an Opo-opo GCD, such that <strong>RoF</strong> will come up before one of the three GCDs of the sequence. We can then order the three GCDs from weakest to strongest, which will often result in a weaker GCD being moved before <strong>RoF</strong> and stronger GCDs into <strong>RoF</strong>. Examples will be shown in the <strong>Burst in Practice</strong> section.</p><p>Third is the placement relative to buffs. <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> has a 40 second cooldown and allows us to hold 2 charges. Our burst windows occur along 120 second intervals. We can fit 3 uses of Perfect Balance across this 2 minute span of time. We have established that the even window is the stronger of the 2 burst windows, and so we will put 2 uses of Perfect Balance into our even windows, and 1 use into our odd windows.</p><h3 id=nadi-alignment-and-overcapping>Nadi Alignment and Overcapping</h3><p>Keeping in mind that <strong>Opo-opo</strong> GCDs are our strongest form and <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> being our strongest GCD, we aim to optimise the amount of both, and also moving as many into Riddle of Fire and other buffs. If we follow the guideline of using two <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> in even windows and one <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> in odd windows, then we will collect a Solar Nadi and a Lunar Nadi in our opener, which will naturally give us our first <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> in the first odd minute window.</p><p>If we strategically overcap the same Nadi by generating the same one twice, we can move <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> into our 2 minutes and subsequent even windows instead. This is usually preferred as the even windows contain both your buffs, as well as buffs of your party members. While ensuring that our strongest GCD is fully buffed sounds enticing, it might cause us to lose a <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> overall, as we are effectively pushing back the PR by one <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> usage. However with the buffs to <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> and Lunar sequences in Dawntrail, the loss of a <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> is usually not very significant the longer the fights become. Our preferred Nadi to overcap is the Lunar one, as it produces more Opo-opo GCDs.</p><p>The choice of optimal Nadi Alignment can change from fight to fight, but will mostly depend on the kill time.</p><h2 id=burst-in-practice>Burst in Practice</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s briefly touch on the <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong>, <strong>Brotherhood</strong> and <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> rules as a refresher before we start to put them into use.</p><ul><li>Always press <strong>RoF</strong> and <strong>BH</strong> on cooldown, keeping them aligned</li><li>Always late weave <strong>RoF</strong></li><li>Always <strong>PB</strong> after an Opo GCD</li><li>Always Opo GCD with <strong>Formless Fist</strong> (after <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> and <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong>)</li><li>1 <strong>PB</strong> in Odd windows, 2 <strong>PB</strong> in Even windows</li></ul><p>These 5 key pieces of information are all we need to construct our odd and even burst windows.</p><h3 id=solar-odd-windows>Solar Odd Windows</h3><p>A <strong>Solar Odd window</strong> is, as the name suggests, is an odd window consisting of a single Solar nadi (<strong>Rising Phoenix</strong>).</p><p>To perform a Solar Odd window, we are looking to use <strong>PB</strong> before <strong>RoF</strong>. As touched on previously, this is in an effort to shift weaker GCDs outside of Riddle of Fire where possible, by using the Perfect Balance GCDs in the order of weakest > strongest.</p><p>We want to place the <strong>PB</strong> after the Opo-opo GCD that occurs when <strong>RoF</strong> has around 2-7 seconds left on cooldown. This will ensure that the resulting <strong>Rising Phoenix</strong> becomes ready after the usual 3 GCDs and will always fit into <strong>RoF</strong>. We then follow the <strong>Rising Phoenix</strong> with another Opo-opo GCD that is granted to us by the <strong>Formless Fist</strong>.</p><p>The following infographic shows how our desired Solar Odd windows will look:</p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[203 164 15 208 339 17]" src=/img/jobs/mnk/solar-odd.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p> </p><h3 id=lunar-odd-windows>Lunar Odd Windows</h3><p>A <strong>Lunar Odd window</strong> is an odd window where we are doing a Lunar Perfect Balance sequence (3x <strong>Opo-opo GCDs</strong>), but not necessarily generating a Lunar solar nadi. This is because these Odd windows can either consist of <strong>Elixir Burst</strong>, which will generate a Lunar nadi, or a <strong>Phantom Rush</strong>, which will instead spend both nadi.</p><p>To perform a Lunar Odd window, we are looking to use <strong>PB</strong> <em>after</em> <strong>RoF</strong>. This is because, as we continue to mention, Opo-opo GCDs are our most valuable GCD, and so we want to maximise the amount of potential buffed <strong>Leaping Opo</strong>s within this <strong>RoF</strong> window.</p><p>Specifically, we will be placing the Perfect Balance use after the first Opo-opo GCD that occurs following the use of Riddle of Fire. This ensures that all of the relevant GCDs, including our Masterful Blitz and Fire&rsquo;s Reply, will fall within the burst window.</p><p>Below is an image demonstrating how these Lunar odd windows will look.</p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[285 106 168 153 2 38]" src=/img/jobs/mnk/lunar-odd.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p> </p><h4 id=umm-actually-lunar-odd-windows>&ldquo;Umm Actually&rdquo; Lunar Odd Windows</h4><p>While using <strong>PB</strong> after <strong>RoF</strong> is almost always correct, there is one specific case where this is unfortunately not quite optimal. This is mostly being included for brevity and completeness of this guide, as in reality this can be hard to recognize on the fly, and rarely ever actually occurs.</p><p>Essentially this window happens if a <strong>Leaping Opo</strong> happens 2 GCDs (around ~3s) before <strong>RoF</strong> comes off cooldown, in which case pressing <strong>PB</strong> before <strong>RoF</strong> is better. This will allow us to move a <strong>Dragon Kick</strong> out of the window, and instead trades it with a Raptor GCD, allowing for a gain of - at most - 220 potency in <strong>RoF</strong>.</p><p>Below is a visualisation of what a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; lunar odd window featuring a Leaping Opo in this position looks like, and what an &ldquo;Umm Actually&rdquo; window looks like in comparison.</p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[354 342 454 124 5 262]" src=/img/jobs/mnk/lunar-actually.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p> </p><h3 id=even-windows>Even Windows</h3><p>Our even windows will include the following mandatory GCDs:</p><ul><li>2 <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong></li><li><strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong></li><li>2 <strong>Formless Fist</strong> used on Opo-opo GCDs</li><li>3 <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> GCDs (ideally a Lunar sequence)</li><li><strong>Wind&rsquo;s Reply</strong> - if available</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s 8 (9 with <strong>WR</strong>) GCDs that we need to squeeze into our 11 GCD <strong>RoF</strong> window.
This requires us to use <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> prior to <strong>Riddle of Fire</strong>, as there is simply not enough space in the 11 available RoF GCDs to fit 2 full <strong>Perfect Balance</strong> uses in tandem with all the requisite <strong>Opo GCDs</strong> and <strong>Replies</strong>.</p><p>Thankfully this ends up making it so that regardless of our Nadi state, all of the even window entries are the same, and so identifying how to being an even burst can be summarised in the following manner:</p><ul><li><p>When you press an Opo-opo GCD 2-4 GCDs before <strong>RoF</strong> and <strong>BH</strong> come off cooldown, follow it with a <strong>Perfect Balance</strong></p><ul><li>Alternative identifier: when you press an Opo GCD while <strong>RoF</strong> and <strong>BH</strong> have between 2-7 seconds left on cooldown</li></ul></li></ul><p>This timing ensures that the <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> built from our first <strong>PB</strong> will always be under <strong>RoF</strong> and <strong>BH</strong>, while also having enough space left over to fit the rest of the burst into Riddle of Fire. This is the exact same principle used in Solar Odd windows.</p><p>From here we just follow the 5 key rules as established. The first <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> will either be a Solar or a Lunar sequence, depending on nadi state going into the window. If it is a Lunar sequence we will spend the <strong>PB</strong> GCDs on Opo-opo Form, and if it is a Solar sequence we will instead order the 3 different form GCDs from weakest to strongest. We use the <strong>Formless Fist</strong> granted by <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> on an Opo-opo GCD. And follow it by a Lunar sequence <strong>PB</strong>. The <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> is placed appropriately after the Opo-opo GCD following either of the Blitzes as usual, or after the 3 <strong>PB</strong> GCDs. Its <strong>Formless Fist</strong> is also followed by an Opo-opo GCD. <strong>Wind&rsquo;s Reply</strong> can be placed anywhere in this sequence.</p><p>Below is a visual of how even windows will look.</p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[52 153 368 325 220 442]" src=/img/jobs/mnk/even.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt></div></p><p> </p><h4 id=fixing-the--3-pb>Fixing the -3 PB</h4><p>In the instance that you misidentify a -3 <strong>PB</strong> (3 GCDs before <strong>RoF</strong>) window, you will arrive at what is known as &rsquo;the dreaded Even 0 window&rsquo;. <strong>PB</strong>, <strong>RoF</strong> and <strong>BH</strong> will come up in the same GCD, requiring a triple-weave to stick to our established rules.</p><p>Thankfully there is an elegant solution to this problem.</p><p>Instead of triple weaving <strong>PB</strong>, <strong>BH</strong>, and <strong>RoF</strong>, the solution is to double weave <strong>BH</strong> and <strong>RoF</strong> as standard, then immediately follow up with <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong>. From here you can continue as normal; with your Opo GCD -> PB windows.</p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[141 297 199 75 274 50]" src=/img/jobs/mnk/even0-save.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt=even0 title="Even 0 Fix"></div></p><p> </p><h3 id=fires-reply-flexibility>Fire&rsquo;s Reply Flexibility</h3><p>Throughout the previous sections the usage of <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> has been statically defined, placing it immediately after an Opo GCD that follows a Masterful Blitz in every use case. However, if you have been paying close attention to the rules that we are following as we established them, you may realise that there is actually more flexiblity in where <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> can be used than it first appears.</p><p>In all but name, <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> is exactly the same as <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> - it requires no form, and grants us Formless Fist. This means that we could, for example, execute a Perfect Balance, spend our 3 Perfect Balance GCDs, and then instead of immediately following with the Blitz, we could instead use <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> > <strong>Opo GCD</strong> > <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> instead. In terms of potency nothing changes, but this does allow us to move around the single ranged GCD that is available in our burst window, which can be very beneficial to us in encounters where being in melee range 100% of the time is not a given.</p><p>This has been touched on slightly when discussing how to fix a broken -3 PB window, but in leaning into this flexibility we find a world of possiblity. You could opt to use Fire&rsquo;s Reply after the 2nd blitz of an even window instead, or pending the 2nd sequence of Perfect Balance GCDs before using Masterful Blitz.</p><p>In odd windows you also have the opportunity to briefly sit on Fire&rsquo;s Reply, performing another loop of your basic 123 combo before using <strong>Fire&rsquo;s Reply</strong> following the next Opo GCD instead.</p><p>This flexibility makes Fire&rsquo;s Reply a very powerful uptime tool, as it allows us to roll our GCD even when out of range. This said, very often you might find yourself in a situation where you need to leave melee range, but there is no suitable <strong>FR</strong> use that maximizes the Opo-opo GCDs. In such cases it can and should be used more flexibly after any GCD, as a lost GCD is always worse than using <strong>FR</strong> sub-optimally.</p><h2 id=openers>Openers</h2><p>With Nadi Alignment and Overcapping in mind, there are two primary openers available to us, though additional options and variations exist. Our best options are the <strong>Double Lunar</strong> and <strong>Solar Lunar</strong> openers and their variations. The popular variations that every player should know for each opener is the 5s Buff variant and the 7s Buff variant.</p><p>The reason these 2 different variations exist is because certain other jobs have different preferences for when they burst/buff in their opener. As either option is fine for us, we can accommodate whatever timing best suits the rest of our party.</p><p>The <strong>Solar Lunar</strong> opener aims to maximize the amounts of <strong>Phantom Rushes</strong> throughout an encounter, as it does not overcap Nadi like the <strong>Double Lunar</strong> opener does. <strong>Double Lunar</strong> sets us up with a Nadi overcap, ideal for shifting the <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> into Even windows instead. Depending on which nadi state we begin a fight with, our following odd and even windows will be different.</p><h3 id=solar-lunar>Solar Lunar</h3><p><div class=md__image><img id="[108 335 90 104 182 192]" src=/img/jobs/mnk/monk-solar-lunar-dk-opener-5s-buffs-.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt="Solar Lunar 5s Opener " title="Solar Lunar 5s Opener"></div></p><p> </p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[148 484 437 157 446 123]" src=/img/jobs/mnk/monk-solar-lunar-dk-opener-7s-buffs-.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt="Solar Lunar 7s Opener" title="Solar Lunar 7s Opener"></div></p><p>Above are the most popular Solar Lunar openers.

The choice will largely depend on your party&rsquo;s preferred buff timing. Most party compositions will prefer 5s Buffs.</p><p>The <strong>Double Lunar</strong> Opener sets up for both the <strong>Double Lunar</strong> and the <strong>Triple Lunar</strong> path, which is the amount of times we overcap the Lunar Nadi before continuing building Nadis as usual.</p><ul><li>For <strong>Double Lunar</strong> we want to continue with <strong>Solar</strong> Odd windows and <strong>Double Lunar</strong> Even windows. This path will have <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> as our first <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> in the Even windows.</li><li>For <strong>Triple Lunar</strong> we do <strong>Lunar</strong> Odd windows and <strong>Solar Lunar</strong> Even windows. This path will have <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> as our second <strong>Masterful Blitz</strong> in the Even windows.</li></ul><h2 id=picking-your-path>Picking Your Path</h2><p>You can play any of the openers and subsequent paths without a very large loss, however will of course always be an optimal choice for any given situation. This optimal choice is always <strong>strongly</strong> related to kill time, as the wrong kill times for <strong>Double Lunar</strong> and <strong>Triple Lunar</strong> can result in the loss of a <strong>Phantom Rush</strong>. As such, in a vacuum, <strong>Solar Lunar</strong> tends to be safest option for personal damage, as it maximizes the amount of <strong>Phantom Rushes</strong> for any kill time. While losing a <strong>Phantom Rush</strong> used to be a bigger loss in Endwalker, even if it is put into Even windows. In Dawntrail it is no longer that big of a loss, and a couple of buffs might already be enough to make it better in terms of party dps.</p><p>For the kill times the <strong>PR</strong> is not lost, <strong>Double Lunar</strong> and <strong>Triple Lunar</strong> will perform a lot better than <strong>Solar Lunar</strong>, while the latter will only perform slightly better when it gains a <strong>PR</strong> over the other paths.</p><p>With this in mind, if the kill time is unknown, we recommend either the use of <strong>Solar Lunar</strong> or <strong>Double Lunar</strong>. While the choice of the former is the safest option, the <strong>Double Lunar</strong> path can be chosen, as it is a larger gain for most kill times compared to <strong>Solar Lunar</strong>, and is only a small loss otherwise for the remaining kill times, especially when factoring in party buffs.</p><p>For optimized settings, the kill time is usually known and the path can be picked accordingly. In terms of buff contribution and keeping your friends with party buffs happy, both <strong>Double Lunar</strong> and <strong>Triple Lunar</strong> will be the preferred paths, even if it comes at a slight loss of personal dps, and sometimes even party dps with a small amount of party buffs.</p><hr><p>Still have questions?
