As a basic overview, the rotation is a builder-spender rotation focused on optimizing damage dealt every minute inside <strong>No Mercy</strong>, which is a 20% damage buff that lasts for 20 seconds after its use.</p><p>We must establish some basic concepts about the gauge usage, buff management, and buff usage before explaining the rotation.</p></br><h2 id=powder-gauge>Powder Gauge</h2><hr><p>The powder gauge (or cartridge gauge) carries a maximum of 3 charges (cartridges), which is the resource required in order to cast all of the desired cooldowns within each usage of <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</p><p>The actions that will fill the cartridge gauge are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Solid Barrel</strong> and <strong>Demon Slaughter</strong> both generate one cartridge upon finishing their combo.</li><li>These combo chains cannot be broken unless switching from one to the other or using the wrong action in sequence.</li><li><strong>Bloodfest</strong> will completely refill the cartridge gauge.</li></ul><p>The actions that will spend cartridges from the gauge are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Gnashing Fang, Double Down, Burst Strike,</strong> and <strong>Fated Circle</strong> all spend one cartridge.</li><li><strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> is broken by the cartridge-generating combos and <strong>Reign of Beasts</strong>.</li></ul><p>Familiarizing yourself with each combo and how they work is important. You should generally never break an active combo or finish a combo that will generate another charge while the powder gauge is full, as that would overwrite the charge.</p></br><h2 id=how-damage-works-with-buffs>How Damage Works With Buffs</h2><hr><h3 id=damage-snapshotting>Damage Snapshotting</h3><p>Understanding damage &ldquo;snapshotting&rdquo; is important because it significantly impacts the correct approach to buff usage, which is relevant to us because of our buff, <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</p><ul><li>Action damage is calculated instantaneously when the server receives the request to use that action, not when the action applies to a target.</li><li>In other words, if you use an action when a buff is active, the effects of that buff are saved permanently, regardless of how long it takes for that action to deal damage or heal a target.</li><li>Debuff-based damage over time effects such as <strong>Sonic Break</strong> function in the same way, allowing for more flexible usage of <strong>Sonic Break</strong> since the entire effect is buffed regardless of when <strong>Sonic Break</strong> is used.</li></ul><p>This allows a ninth GCD to be buffed by <strong>No Mercy</strong> at GCD recast speeds faster than 2.50, and allows <strong>Sonic Break</strong> to flexibly move as a gap filler for certain optimizations (or mistake recovery) within the burst phase since the effect duration is fully buffed so long as it was initially cast at some point while <strong>No Mercy</strong> was active.</p></br><h2 id=no-mercy>No Mercy</h2><hr><h3 id=9-gcd-no-mercy>9 GCD No Mercy</h3><p>Acquiring the ninth GCD within <strong>No Mercy</strong> requires a specific usage time relative to the GCD indicator roll. Using <strong>No Mercy</strong> very early in the GCD roll would result in the buff activating while your GCD is still on-cooldown, wasting active buff time as you wait for the next GCD to be usable.</p><p>For GCD recast speeds faster than 2.50, <strong>No Mercy</strong> must be cast as a &ldquo;late weave&rdquo; to attain the 9th GCD, or if imagining the indicator as a clock, when the rolling GCD indicator reaches a &ldquo;nearly-9-o-clock&rdquo; position. <strong>No Mercy</strong> takes slightly over half a second (600ms) to activate after pressing it, so using <strong>No Mercy</strong> as a late weave results in the buff activating at the same time that the next GCD can be cast, wasting little to no active buff time and permitting the use of a ninth GCD within the final second of <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</p><h3 id=usage-timing-by-gcd-recast-speed>Usage Timing By GCD Recast Speed</h3><p>Not every GCD recast speed is a good fit for <strong>No Mercy</strong>. Some speeds within the range Gunbreaker typically plays at can and will cause inevitable drift because of how a 60 second cooldown aligns to the number of possible GCDs at that GCD speed within a 60 second period. This will drift you away from party buffs, potentially damaging your DPS.</p><p>To minimize this as much as possible, there are basic usage guidelines for when to cast <strong>No Mercy</strong> based on <strong>GCD speed ranges</strong>. The <strong>fastest speed within each listed range</strong> is the speed that has the <strong>least drift</strong>. Deviating to a slower speed will linearly increase the innate drift that occurs with every usage of <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</p><p><strong>2.50 GCD</strong></p><ul><li>Use <strong>No Mercy</strong> off cooldown whenever it is usable, but preferably as an early weave (3 o&rsquo;clock).</li></ul><p><strong>2.45 - 2.47 GCD</strong></p><ul><li>Without <strong>Bloodfest</strong>, use <strong>No Mercy</strong> off cooldown as an early weave (3 o&rsquo;clock).</li><li>With <strong>Bloodfest</strong>, use <strong>No Mercy</strong> off cooldown as a late weave (9 o&rsquo;clock).</li></ul><p><strong>2.40 - 2.44 GCD</strong></p><ul><li>Use <strong>No Mercy</strong> off cooldown as a late weave (9 o&rsquo;clock).</li></ul><h1 id=openers>Openers</h1><p><div class=md__image><img id="[363 345 296 84 145 419]" src=https://u.cubeupload.com/krom/PKVD4O.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt="2.50 GNB Opener"></div></p><p><div class=md__image><img id="[116 447 393 214 159 227]" src=https://u.cubeupload.com/krom/sjDxEW.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt="2.4N GNB Opener"></div></p><h3 id=opener-notes>Opener Notes</h3><ul><li>The <strong>Lightning Shot</strong> cast is suggested for threat generation and raid buff alignment.<ul><li><strong>Trajectory</strong> can be used at -0.66s to replace <strong>Lightning Shot</strong> (1/10th threat generation).</li><li><strong>Provoke</strong> can be used at -0.6s to replace <strong>Lightning Shot</strong>, but this is not advised without knowing the fight timeline because <strong>Provoke</strong> may be necessary within the first 30 seconds of the fight for a tank swap and can waste a pull.</li></ul></li><li>When opting out of using <strong>Lightning Shot</strong> in the case of an encounter that can begin within melee range or by using alternative pulling options listed above, it may be necessary to start <strong>No Mercy</strong> after a third GCD to ensure raid buff alignment remains mostly optimized.<ul><li>For 2.50, the opening GCDs would be <strong>Keen Edge</strong>, <strong>Brutal Shell</strong>, and <strong>Burst Strike</strong>.</li><li>For 2.4n, the opening GCDs would be <strong>Keen Edge</strong>, <strong>Brutal Shell</strong>, and <strong>Solid Barrel</strong>. <strong>Bloodfest</strong> would be held to <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong>, and <strong>Bow Shock</strong> would be held to <strong>Double Down</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sonic Break</strong> being used on the 9th GCD in the 2.4n Opener has caveats:<ul><li>It is the least risky choice to keep <strong>Hypervelocity</strong> inside of <strong>No Mercy</strong>.

Since <strong>No Mercy</strong> should ideally not drift to maintain alignment and <strong>No Mercy</strong> should not begin with 3 cartridges at 2.50, there is only one solution to that situation that avoids both problems:<br><br>Reduce to 1 cartridge by casting a <strong>Burst Strike</strong> in place of that <strong>Solid Barrel</strong>. This will force <strong>Sonic Break</strong> to be cast at either the first or second GCD of <strong>No Mercy</strong> to prevent a combo action from taking the place of <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> or <strong>Double Down</strong>. Either <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> or <strong>Double Down</strong> (or both, depending on where you place <strong>Sonic Break</strong>) will drift by 1 GCD in the process, but <strong>Bloodfest</strong> and <strong>No Mercy</strong> will not drift with no potency loss during the burst phase.</p><p>All future usages of <strong>No Mercy with Bloodfest</strong> will begin with 1 cartridge. Encountering any additional rotational upsets can potentially force <strong>No Mercy</strong> to begin off cooldown again with two cartridges.

Hold them back into <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</li><li>2.40, 2.45, and 2.50 are driftless for party raid buffs and <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</li><li>2.45 requires less than or equal to ~50ms ping (or plugins) to not clip/drift <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</li><li>Other GCDs cause some amount of buff drift, potentially drifting <strong>No Mercy</strong> from raid buffs.</li><li>This does not mean that other speeds are unplayable or bad, but it does add the risk of losing bonus raid buff damage.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=reverse-drift>Reverse Drift</h3><p>Skill Speed (SKS) modifies GCD cooldowns by reducing their cooldowns by 0.1% per SKS tier. This is done to help GCD cooldowns remain aligned to the GCD and not clip them aggressively.</p><p>This benefit is not extended to oGCD cooldowns. This is done intentionally to keep <strong>No Mercy</strong> aligned to party raid buffs, but it creates misalignment between GCD cooldowns like <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> and oGCD cooldowns like <strong>No Mercy</strong>, because GCD cooldowns like <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> begin coming off cooldown sooner than <strong>No Mercy</strong> does. This is referred to as “<strong>reverse drift</strong>", because cooldowns are readied for use too early relative to the buff they should be used in.</p><p>The solution to &ldquo;reverse drift&rdquo; is simple - pretend the cooldown reduction does not exist and hold the GCD cooldowns back into <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</p><h3 id=cooldown-drift>Cooldown Drift</h3><p>Similarly to how GCD cooldowns do not align to <strong>No Mercy</strong> with SKS, certain GCD speeds do not align themselves to oGCD cooldowns either. This causes oGCD cooldowns to occasionally drift into the next GCD, because they would interrupt the next GCD cast if they were cast upon becoming ready for use due to animation lock.</p><p>Animation lock plays a significant limiting role in whether or not you can press an action when it becomes ready for use, because animation lock from the previous action used (either GCD or oGCD) must end before any other action may be cast. This is why casting oGCDs right before the next GCD is about to be pressed can interrupt the next GCD and cause a GCD clip. <strong>This limits the timing with the GCD roll that oGCDs can be cast without clipping the GCD, and that room is both ping dependent and FPS dependent.</strong></p><ul><li>Higher ping results in longer animation lock, reducing the weaving room before GCD clipping occurs.</li><li>In regards to FPS, a new GCD can only begin on a new frame, so a microscopic clip that you cannot visually see occurs while you wait for a new frame to generate showing the GCD as usable to the game client. Technically speaking, this increases the time you can weave because you would have clipped by that amount regardless.</li></ul><p>Determining how much a cooldown will “shift” from the last position it came off cooldown per use on any given speed is found by dividing the cooldown length by the GCD speed.</p><ul><li>As an example, 60s / 2.50s GCD = 24 GCDs per <strong>No Mercy</strong> or <strong>Bow Shock</strong>, meaning a 60 second cooldown will come off cooldown exactly every 24 GCD rolls from wherever the last usage occurred. Practically, this means that oGCD cooldown will never be ready for use at a different place in relation to the GCD roll as long as the GCD roll was never interrupted or stopped. This can be observed by playing 2.50 and using a 60 second cooldown, then repeatedly spamming one GCD action until the 60 second cooldown becomes ready for use again.</li><li>On 2.46, this becomes 60s / 2.46s GCD = 24.39 GCDs, meaning that <strong>No Mercy</strong> will become ready for use again +0.39 GCDs after the last time it was cast relative to the GCD roll, because 24 GCD rolls have completed and another 0.39 GCDs must occur before it will become ready for use again. Using a clock example, if the last cast was at 3 o&rsquo;clock, the next time <strong>No Mercy</strong> will be available for use is approximately at 7 o&rsquo;clock relative to the GCD indicator roll.</li></ul><p>This observed shift in where a cooldown becomes ready for use again will accumulate with every usage to the point that the cooldown will eventually become ready for use at a point that it cannot be used without interrupting the next GCD cast, forcing the cooldown to be held to the next GCD and then be used at the earliest usable point within the next GCD roll.</p><p>What this means for the rotation is that some GCD speeds are just uniquely worse at aligning to oGCDs and will cause more drift than other speeds will over the course of a fight. This can be very important for both raid buffs and preventing loss of cooldown usages, and due to how loaded the burst window is at level 100, it becomes very unfavorable to drift out of party buffs due to uncontrollable GCD speed-based drift because high-potency actions such as <strong>Lionheart</strong> will leave party buffs first.</p><p>The speeds that do NOT drift <strong>No Mercy</strong> by any significant amount are as follows:</p><ul><li>2.50 GCD (0.00s drift per use)</li><li>2.45 GCD (0.05s drift per every other use) <strong>(PING DEPENDENT - ≤50MS TO NOT CLIP OR DRIFT)</strong></li><li>2.40 GCD (0.00s drift per use)</li></ul><p>Those three speeds in particular are the most favorable for staying aligned with party buffs. Going from 2.40 to 2.42 would increase the drift rate because it would take longer for <strong>No Mercy</strong> to return to the same ideal usage point, and the cooldown can only be used one time per drift. In specific, it would cause <strong>2.42 * (1 - (60 / 2.42 - 24) = 0.5s</strong> of drift per <strong>No Mercy</strong> (excluding factors like innate clip rate from <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> or framerate). This drift linearly increases or decreases within the respective speed range of 2.40 - 2.44 as the GCD is slowed or sped up respectively, and the same holds true of 2.45 - 2.47 which can use <strong>No Mercy</strong> twice off cooldown between drifts of <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</p><p>Keep in mind that this doesn’t necessarily mean 2.40 is always better than 2.42 or something slower, it just means that the <em>risk</em> of losing raid buff damage over extended periods of time where raid buffs never realign to <strong>No Mercy</strong> is increased when running other speeds, which can potentially be a damage loss depending on the encounter.</p></br><h2 id=recovery-considerations>Recovery Considerations</h2><hr><h3 id=section-tldr-2>SECTION TLDR:</h3><ul><li>Recovery depends somewhat on GCD speed. Faster speeds are easier to recover because of cooldown reduction and extra <strong>No Mercy</strong> space.</li><li>The goal of recovery is to fit the desired cooldowns back into <strong>No Mercy</strong>, not necessarily keep them in their original order.</li><li>Use <strong>Bloodfest</strong> earlier or later to solve GCD cooldown usage issues or powder gauge issues respectively.</li><li>Use <strong>Sonic Break</strong> to fill in drifted cooldown space where <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> or <strong>Double Down</strong> would normally be.</li><li>Consider the use of <strong>Reign of Beasts</strong> earlier to flip the place of the <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> combo if <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> has drifted excessively.</li></ul><hr><p>Recovery is always a situational problem that has specific answers for each scenario. It is a multifaceted problem that depends on fight time available, the nature of the recovery (between death, drift, or lack of resources), GCD speed, and previous cooldown position with specific cooldowns like <strong>Bloodfest</strong>.</p><p>Recovery does not necessarily mean returning to a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; state of play that you are used to. You will have to adapt to cooldown shifts and learn to play with your cooldowns being out of order. The order of your cooldowns is irrelevant as long as nothing is pushed out of your buff, <strong>No Mercy</strong>.</p><p>GCD speed with Gunbreaker results in differing requirements for recovery, because adding speed introduces cooldown reduction to <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> and <strong>Double Down</strong>. This means that their cooldowns will become ready for use earlier than they were in your previous burst phase. This can be used to your advantage if either cooldown ever drifts, because it is unlikely that you will need to hold <strong>No Mercy</strong> or do anything special with <strong>Bloodfest</strong> to realign them or keep your burst phase (with <strong>Bloodfest</strong>) from developing an undesired space filled with suboptimal GCDs.</p><p>Faster GCD speed also permits the ability to have a 9th GCD available within <strong>No Mercy</strong>, which allows for additional room to move cooldowns around without drifting them outside of your buff.</p><p><strong>Sonic Break</strong> can be moved anywhere necessary to fill in the space of a drifted GCD cooldown. If <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> drifts, an undesired space will form within your burst phase (with <strong>Bloodfest</strong>) that, on slower speeds, would potentially necessitate the usage of a suboptimal filler GCD in it&rsquo;s place. Since <strong>Sonic Break</strong> does not have a cooldown, it can be placed in that undesired space to prevent the usage of suboptimal GCDs.</p><p>Regarding suboptimal GCD space, if <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> drifts excessively to the point that an undesired space during your burst phase (with <strong>Bloodfest</strong>) is unavoidable even after moving <strong>Sonic Break</strong> into the original place of <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong>, then you can opt to use the <strong>Reign of Beasts</strong> combo earlier and flip the usage order between <strong>Reign of Beasts</strong> and <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong>, which may drift <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> further slightly into your burst phase, but will prevent the formation of undesired suboptimal GCD space that would push out important cooldowns.</p><ul><li>This may be necessary if you die and revive with the ability to press <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> inbetween burst phases during filler. If <strong>No Mercy</strong> has >15 seconds left when you are able to press <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong>, you can do so without pushing the next <strong>Gnashing Fang</strong> out of <strong>No Mercy</strong>, but it will be pushed to the very end of your burst phase.</li></ul><p>If none of these heuristics are available options, a small delay to <strong>No Mercy</strong> of a GCD or two will typically permit the ability to fit all of your cooldowns within <strong>No Mercy</strong> again.</p><h1 id=aoe-priority>AOE Priority</h1><h2 id=level-100>Level 100</h2><ul><li><p>Use the <strong>Demon Slaughter</strong> combo on 3 targets or more.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>Fated Circle</strong> on 2 targets or more.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>Double Down</strong> on any number of targets, preferably positioning yourself to strike as many targets as possible.</p></li><li><p>Use <strong>Reign of Beasts</strong>&rsquo;

Every pull you make should be a live re-assessment of your usage timing on mitigation such as Reprisal and Heart of Light (or any personal mitigation) to evaluate if you can either cover additional instances of damage with the same usage, or gain additional usages of that cooldown later while still covering the same instance of damage with the current usage.</p><p>Give yourself appropriate time to weave mitigation during your normal rotation. Utilize the long active timer of your heavy mitigation to your advantage and use it before the cast if necessary to permit weaving needs. It only needs to be active for the hit preparation.</p><p>The majority of tankbusters can be resolved through a basic strategy of employing either Rampart and Camoflauge tied with Heart of Corundum, or Nebula tied with Heart of Corundum. Some strategies may prefer that you use Superbolide as well.</p><p>Heart of Corundum is also an extremely flexible action in the sense that you can use it and abuse the proc timer of Catharsis of Corundum, which is the 900 potency heal effect that it carries. The proc heal does not go off until 20 seconds expire, or a player drops below 50% HP. This allows niche strategies to be employed that allow you to very precisely time a heal to go off at the ideal time, where healing is necessary but mitigation is not.</p></br><h2 id=dungeon-tips>Dungeon Tips</h2><hr><p>Attempt to pull wall-to-wall if the healer is capable of handling it.<br>Use your cooldowns as follows:</p><p><strong>General Tips</strong></p><ul><li>Prepull Heart of Corundum early to proc free healing as you are running.</li><li>Apply Aurora to help buffer into any required healing.</li><li>Apply Superbolide as needed if healer help is required.</li><li>Lightly space mitigations out over a couple of GCDs, but ensure most of it is active while the majority of the dungeon targets are alive.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re playing with a WHM, let them cast Holy on the mobs before mitting.</li></ul><p><strong>First Wall to Wall</strong>:</p><ul><li>Rampart and Camoflauge</li><li>Heart of Corundum (off cooldown)</li><li>Reprisal</li><li>Low Blow (off cooldown)</li><li>Consider Heart of Light (5% physical)</li></ul><p><strong>Second Wall to Wall</strong>:</p><ul><li>Great Nebula and Arm&rsquo;s Length</li><li>Heart of Corundum (off cooldown)</li><li>Reprisal</li><li>Low Blow (off cooldown)</li></ul><p>After Great Nebula expires, Rampart/Camoflauge/Heart of Light should be coming off cooldown again.</p><p>This plan works for the majority of dungeon encounters.
