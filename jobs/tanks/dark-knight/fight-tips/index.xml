In particular, &lt;strong&gt;The Blackest Night&lt;/strong&gt; (TBN) and &lt;strong&gt;Dark Mind&lt;/strong&gt; overperform throughout this ultimate, and mitigating damage is incredibly comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate) DRK Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/fight-tips/the-unending-coil-of-bahamut-ultimate-drk-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 02:23:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/fight-tips/the-unending-coil-of-bahamut-ultimate-drk-guide/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
