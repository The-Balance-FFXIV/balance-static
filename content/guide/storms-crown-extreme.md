<h1>Introduction to Storm's Crown (Extreme)</h1>

The Storm's Crown (Extreme) is an 8-man encoutner released with patch 6.2, Buried Memories. This fight requires a minimum item level of 600, but may be bypassed by queueing into it with a preformed party.


<h2>Positioning and Setup</h2>


Groups should first choose clock positions by placing one player on each cardinal and intercardinal position of the arena. Ideally, Tanks and Healers should be placed on cardinal positions while DPS should be on intercardinals. Once this has been sorted out, divide the party into two groups (light parties) with one Tank, one Healer, and two DPS in each.

 

 
These are the markers I used and I’ll explain when we get to that.



 
Now that the prep is out of the way lets get to the fight. I’ll keep this timeline on the side to show where we are at, where we were, and where we’re going for when you review the parts of the fight and want the order.
 
The first mechanic is Void Aero IV – this is a standard raid wide
 
Following this is Savage Barbery this is a two part mechanic.
8          	The first thing to look for is the direction she’s throwing the sword by noticing the indicator, you will be moving away from this
9          	Next look at how she is holding the sword if it’s a forward low stance like this you will stay inside her hitbox. If it’s a high stance like this you will be outside her hitbox. Remember, always opposite the direction of the indicator.
 
10Following every Savage Barbery is Hair Raid. This is also a two step mechanic
11       	First look at wether she crouches to the ground or stands tall. If she crouches you need to run to the sword she threw, if she stands tall you stay in her hitbox
12       	Next she will either indicate stack or spread. If you are stack its easy enough.
13       	For spread it matters wether its in her hitbox or at the wall. For in her hitbox you just move out to your clockspot. If its at the wall use the same side as your light party group. (Let melee take the closer positions) You can also move out after the cleave if you want.
 
14She then repeats these two mechanics doing the opposite version she originally did. As you can see we had inside the hitbox for savage and then in and spread for hair raid. So this time we get out of hitbox savage and wall with stack for hair raid.
 
15Void Aero IV is used again
 
16A new mechanic is Void Aero III – this is a simple 2 hit tank buster that requires an immunity or swap.
 
17Teasing Tangles – you will be stunned and automatically pair in dps + tank or healer pairs.
18       	Using our fancy waymarks if you receive enumeration you will move towards the boss and towards the number marker in your circle. If you receive a large aoe you move away from the boss and towards the letter marker. The further back you go the safer it is.
19The boss will cast Secret Breeze which will cleave each of the pillars you are tethered to so be careful and stay towards the edge of your circle. If you move outside the circle you will be sucked into the center and probably die. After resolving your mechanic make sure to spread for a protean
 
20Void Aero IV
 
21Curling Iron – This is a raidwide aoe. If you stand under her during the animation of it you will be knocked slightly out (this interrupts casts and does minor damage) During this next section there are no castbar names so I’ll be inventing ones to use. Cheers.
 
22Curling iron is a raidwide aoe that does moderate damage and changes the arena, leaving a wall that applies a heavy dot so beware.
 
23During the transition preposition around the boss hitbox in your protean spot and 4 dashes will cleave each tank and healer one time. When you are hit by the dash(Brutal Rush), dodge left or right to avoid the line aoe that happens after. Being hit does heavy damage and applies a vuln up
 
24After the final dash the boss makes a swirl type aoe and a center circular aoe at the same time. This is easy to dodge but the tanks do need to stack for a double/shared tank buster
 
25When these resolve move to the center of the boss to avoid having to dodge several Aoes as well as preposition yourself for the next mechanic.
 
26You will see large rock icons appear on 6 players heads. Stack everyone center. Wait for the large AoEs they leave behind baited by the players location when they disappear. Then head to your clockspot’s slice of the swirl safe zones.
 
27Your spread will resolve and enumerations appear on tanks and healers. Have tanks and healers rotate cw to meet their dps partner to share the enumeration. Beware the out AoE followed by an IN AoE
 
28Upon resolution spread to your protean spots and DPS will now be dashed to one at a time. Side step as the tanks and healers did before.
 
29Next is Knuckle Drum. These are several AoEs that hit rather hard in total. Be sure to mitigate and heal through this. 10 regular hits than 1 much more powerful hit.
 
30As the knuckledrum finishes you will have all tanks and healers be targeted for dashes. Additionally 4 players at random will place 4 ground aoes. To resolve, stack  everyone north during the knuckledrum s and rotating cw around the boss until the dashes and puddles finish.
 
31When this ends there will eb a knockback aoe in the center of the arena. Send the party south with its stack and tanks ne/nw with flares.
 
32The boss will then target all 4 dps with dashes and hit them one by one. Spread to protean and sidestep as necessary. Be careful of the 4 aoes dropping for the next mechanic
 
33Teasing tangles 2, this one does not have a cast bar and functions differently. The boss will shoot slow moving discs that if you touch, launch you in the air and most likely kill you. After a few have appeared and gone off, you will be forced out with a point blank aoe. During this 2 of the circles will have both players receive enumerations. Dodge the point blank aoe, then the out aoe, while dodging the discs.. Soon after the outer AoE expires enumeration will go off. However you are given a bit of time after the final ground AoE expires so focus on those first.
 
34Next is another round of Knuckle Drums so I hope you didn’t blow all your mitigation yet.
 
35Iron out is another big raid wide without a cast bar that transitions you back to the original arena.
36Entanglement – players are paired with playstation style markers. Send circle north. triagnel East, Cross south, Square West. This is important for later and is easy to remember as you can just look at the color of your button and the marker. Make sure to space the dps slightly counter clockwise and the tank or healer in the pair slightly clockwise.
 
37After your stun ends, The boss will cleave all cardinal directions wih Secret Breeze. Have one player on each side of the cleave. Make sure to not break your tetherbut be far enough you do not get double cleaved by the protean wave from the boss shortly after the cardinal cleaves.
 
38We get a set of Savage Barbery and Hair Raid. Nothing fancy is added. Next is Void Aero III
 
Entanglement 2. Similar in style to the first version this has some extra things added. Start the same way and wait for the enumerations to appear.
39The enumerations are random on which set of buttons get enumerations. This results in 2 configurations.
 
40First configuration the enumerations are across from each other. Simple walk forward and you will naturally walk into your partner to share.
41The other configuration is the enumerations are next to each other such as circle and triangle being enumerations. For this you go to the only side you reasonable can. Then pair up with each other.
 
42Another savage barbery and hair raid will follow with a void aero iv to close
 
43Curling iron will perform a raidwide and send us back to the arena with the wall that applies a heavy dot.
 
44Start by positioning at proteans. Wait for the 4 dashes to resolve on tanks and healersbefore stacking north of the boss.
 
45The boss will perform Knuckle drums again be sure to mitigate and heal.
46Next you will place aoes start north of the boss, rotating cw until you finish. Next go under the boss and palce your red rock aoes before moving out to your protean position.
 
Dps will receiver 4 dahses one at a time. Simply sidestep as they go off.
47Next is get out, then back in with spread and knockback
48  4 more dashes this time on tanks and heals, side step as necessary.
 
49Now the discs of wind will come from the boss with random aoes on the ground. During this another out then in mechanic.
 
50Following this is a spiral slices safe zone and a shared tank buster
 
51Next off is the same pattern of dodges we had in the beginning where we were able to just stand center to dodge, but this time there is a pointblank aoe so we need to go out and side step. Only small movements are needed here. During this mechanic the party should work their way south and tanks north for another party stack with tank flares.
 
52Next is more knuckle drums
 
Iron out is a raid wide taking us back to the original arena.
 
53Here we basically repeat the previous time we got here.
