---
## Introduction

This is a comprehensive guide aimed towards players entering endgame – Level 90 – for the first time and getting overwhelmed with FFXIV's gear progression systems. This guide will help you get an understanding of how FFXIV’s endgame systems work, as well as how to gear up and what types of endgame PvE content exist.

Step 1. Finish MSQ, get AF Gear, and farm Tomestones for gear

## Explanation of Terms, Loot, and Lockouts

* Grand Company and Rowena’s House of Splendors resets at 1PM PST/4PM EST/8PM GMT.
* All of these timers can be viewed in your timezone via the Timers window in-game.
* A lockout means that you can only get a certain amount of rewards until the reset, which then the amount of rewards you can get is refreshed.

### Gear Progression

Upon reaching the level cap, gear progression is based on Item Level, commonly referred to as i# or iL#. For example, if a piece of gear is i600, its item level is 600. The higher the item level, the stronger the piece of equipment is. Upgrading gear is very straightforward in FFXIV.

* Endgame gear with higher item levels are acquired through dungeons, trials, raids, crafting, and tomestones.
* All duties have a required minimum item level. This can be bypassed if queueing with a full premade party.
* The maximum item level is increased during each expansion and each raid patch cycle (even numbered patches), which occur every 7-8 months. The base item level for that patch’s content is the maximum armour item level for the previous patch cycle +10.
* On odd-numbered patches, the maximum item level is not increased, and more ways to upgrade gear are introduced with Alliance raids and Hunts. Odd-numbered patches are commonly referred to as catch-up patches.
* Gear is divided into Weapon and Gear. Gear has Left Side (Head, Chest, Hands, Legs, Feet), and Right Side (Waist, Earrings, Necklace, Bracelet, Ring, Ring).

  * Right side gear equips are considered “accessories”. 
* The current highest item level is \_\_\_ for weapons, and \_\_\_ for armor.
* Best-in-Slot (BiS) gear is the best gear you can possibly have at the time. BiS mixes and matches the strongest endgame sets. Accurate and up-to-date BiS lists can be found on [the Balance](http://discord.com/thebalanceffxiv).

### Allagan Tomestones

* All endgame content from previous expansions rewards Tomestones of Poetics, which can be exchanged for any previous expansion’s endgame gear.
* All endgame content from Endwalker rewards Tomestones of \[tomename].
* \[uncapped] is uncapped, meaning you can get as many as you want. Revelation is capped at \[number] tomes per weekly lockout.
* Tomestones of \[uncapped] can be exchanged for \[iL] \[gearname] Gear.
* Tomestones of \[capped] can be exchanged for \[iL] \[gearname] Gear, which can be upgraded to \[iL] \[gearname] Gear with upgrade items from Pandaemonium (Savage).

  * Rewards an addition \[capped] in addition to the dungeon rewards.

* Level 90 Roulette comprises all Level 90 dungeons not in Expert Roulette.

  * Rewards an additional \[tomestones] in addition to the dungeon rewards.
* Level 50/60/70/80 Roulette comprises all Level 50, 60, 70, and 80 dungeons.

### Extreme Trials and Tokens

Extreme Trials are a full party fight against a singular enemy. They are the gateway between casual content and Savage raiding, being a difficulty step above all casual combat content in the game. Most Extreme Trials reward strong weapons and a coveted Primal mount, while other Extreme Trials can reward accessories or even gear.

* Applicable to all non-ARR Extreme difficulty trials.
* There are no lockouts on Extreme Trials.
* Aside from dropping weapons, completion of an Extreme trial duty will reward tokens.

  * 10 tokens can be traded for one weapon of choice (7 PLD Sword, 3 PLD Shield).
  * 99 tokens can be traded for the duty’s Extreme mount which is a rare drop. This is only applicable after a trial has been released for some time.

### Crafted Gear

Crafted gear is extremely important for high-end raider progression, and it’s important for anyone breaking into endgame content too!

* New crafted gear is released at the beginning of a raid patch cycle, at the patch’s base item level.
* This gear can be acquired through crafting them, having someone else craft them for you with your mats, or the marketboard.
* **Only HQ gear is relevant. Only purchase HQ gear.**
* These offer a good stepping stone to endgame for a new Level 90 player. A full set is expensive at the beginning of a patch cycle but quickly decreases in price.
* Currently, \[item level] crafted gear exist.

### Acquisition of Materia

Materia are gems that you put in your gear to enhance it, giving you additional substats. After you acquire endgame gear, you must get materia to meld into them to maximize their potential and customize your stats. Almost all gear has two materia slots, with some gear such as Ultimate weapons having three and Relic gear having five. 

* You can meld gear at any Materia Melder NPC, or meld gear yourself if you have a crafting job leveled.
* Crafted gear can be “overmelded”, allowing you to put up to five materia in them. Only players with crafting jobs leveled can overmeld gear.
* Materia comes in \[number] grades, and the current endgame grades are \[grades].
* \[grade] is the best materia available, while \[grade] is used strictly for overmelds. \[item] can be traded in for \[grade] materia, while \[item] can be traded in for \[grade] materia. They can be acquired from the following sources:

  * All max level dungeons randomly drop materia, which can be either grade.
  * The Hunt rewards many materia:

    * Rank A mobs sometimes drop \[items]
    * Rank S mobs always drop \[items]
    * \[number] \[currency] can be traded in for any \[grade] materia of your choice, and \[number] \[currency] can be traded in for any \[grade] materia of your choice.
* Converting fully spiritbound endgame gear also gives you materia.
* The Adventurer in Need bonus for Duty Roulette: Leveling and Duty Roulette: Alliance rewards \[items].
* Wondrous Tails sometimes has \[items] as a reward.
* Materia can easily be bought on the Marketboard for gil.
* **Melding your gear is extremely important for endgame content, as it gives you many substats.**

### The Hunt

Track dangerous mobs in order to acquire materia for your endgame gear as well as extra Tomestones. Hunts are the world bosses of FFXIV, which spawn in the overworld at regular intervals. Some rare hunts have difficult spawn conditions, but doing them is well worth the reward.

* Hunts are usually coordinated with a third-party software, Discord, mainly used for VOIP and chatting. In fact, a ton of endgame and social content use Discord. You can get Discord as a mobile app on iOS or Android, open it in a web browser, or download the application on desktop.
* Hunts reward a currency which can be used to purchase gear, materia, and upgrade items. Hunts will also drop Tomestones.
