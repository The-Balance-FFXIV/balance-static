# Standard Opener

![\-3s Pre-pull Current Tincture of Mind\ -1.5s Pre-pull Glare III\ PULL\ Dia\ Glare III\ Glare III Weave: Presence of Mind\ Glare III Weave: Assize Glare III (etc.)](/img/jobs/whm/whm_ew_no_swift_opener.png "No Swift White Mage Endwalker Opener General Use")

In most cases, use this:\
-3s Pre-pull Current Tincture of Mind\
-1.5s Pre-pull Glare III\
PULL\
Dia\
Glare III\
Glare III
Weave: Presence of Mind\
Glare III
Weave: Assize
Glare III
(etc.)

This opener uses both PoM and Assize under raid buffs, Assize is weaved under PoM which can cause clipping even at moderate ping, in most cases this will not be an issue.

# Swiftcase Opener

PRE-PULL\
-3s Current Tincture of Mind\
-1.5s Glare III\
PULL\
Dia\
Glare III\
Glare III\
Weave: Swiftcast\
Glare III\
Weave: Assize and Presence of Mind\
Glare III\
Glare III\
(etc.)

This opener uses swiftcast to double weave Assize and PoM under raid buffs and has less risk of clipping, but will leave you without swiftcast in the first minute of the fight.
