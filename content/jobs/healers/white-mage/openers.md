# Standard Opener

![-2.3s prepull/PULL/Current Tincture of Mind/Dia/Glare III/ Glare III: Weave: Presence of mind/ Glare IV Weave: Assize/Glare IV/ Glare IV/ Afflatus Misery/ Glare III/ Glare III/ Glare III/ Glare III/ Glare III/ Dia](/img/jobs/whm/white-mage-early-dot-refresh-opener.png "WHM Standard Opener")

This opener is **recommended for general content**, and is the one you should use outside of specific circumstances. Glare 4 and Misery can both be moved around in the window, as long as you end the window with Dia. Press your first rapture whenever you need healing after your pot runs out and before the 1 minute window, outside of that just play WHM as normal, using a misery every minute. This opener uses both PoM and Assize under raid buffs. Chain is present purely to show how you will align with buffs.

# Double Misery Opener

![](/img/jobs/whm/white-mage-double-misery-opener.png)

This opener should only be used in specific situations and is not one I would recommend for general use. Notably in 2 target fights from the start it can be a gain. Outside of this all it does is consolidate RNG (higher highs and lower lows) underneath a pot/buffs. It could be used if a fight has an immense amount of healing in the first 30 seconds as well. The Afflatus Rapture's and Glare 4's can be moved around, as long as you don't Afflatus Rapture before the first Afflatus Misery, and make sure to end on Dia.

# Example 2 Minute Burst

Not all 2 minutes will look exactly like this, this is just to have an idea of the structure. Glare IV and Afflatus Misery can both be moved around in the window, as long as you end the window with Dia. Chain is present purely to show how you will align with buffs.
