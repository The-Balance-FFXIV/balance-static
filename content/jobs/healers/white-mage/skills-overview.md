### **Holy III**

* AoE damage in a small 8y radius around you (150p), 2.5s cast time
* In non boss fights, Holy has a stun that gets reduced each time starting off with 4s stun followed by 2s stun and the last stun being 1s.
* Holy is your strongest tool in Dungeons, letting you have an effective seven second stun
* Holy is a gain over Glare III on three targets
* Try to use Swift before Holy in dungeon runs before the first usage, makes the stun chain smooth

* Single target damage (85p) and DoT (10 ticks of 85p), instant cast. Total Potency: 935
* At lower levels you'll have Aero, this is replaced by Dia at level 72

* If Optimizing: 

  * Refreshing Dia early can be a gain if you know your kill/phase time and you know you will lose ticks anyway. 
  * Dia is a gain on Glare III after four ticks.

![Afflatus Misery](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002644_hr1.png)

### **Afflatus Misery**

* AoE damage in a very small 5y radius around enemy target (1,400p), instant cast. Deals 620 potency to enemies that aren’t the main target in a 5y radius. 
* You gain Blood Lily charges when using a Lily charge, you need three lily usages to gain a Blood Lily. Misery can only be activated if you have a Blood Lily
* Three Lilies and a Misery is a DPS gain on two or more targets. Be aware of its small 5y radius and make sure it is hitting two targets.
* Your priority for Misery should be Movement if you have nothing else > Using it into Putting it into raid buffs > before the fight ends
* If you have at least one Blood Lily charge, it's a gain to use as many Lilies as you need to get a Blood Lily before the fight ends.

* Try to delay your own healing or communicate with your cohealer if Assize will be coming off of cooldown before threatening damage. This will allow you to use Assize for both damage and healing
* Delaying Assize to heal can be done if you know you won’t lose a use
* Excellent ability for cleave damage, always a gain to delay if you can hit more than two targets

### **Divine Caress**

* AoE 15y Shield(400p) and Regen (5 ticks of 200p), total heal: 1,000.
* Gain use of Divine Caress after using Temperance for 30 seconds
