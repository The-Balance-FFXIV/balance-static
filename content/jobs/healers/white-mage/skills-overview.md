# Notable Endwalker Changes

* Thin air has two charges but only reduces mana cost on one spell per cast
* Glare cast time reduces to 1.5s
* Presence of Mind changes to a 120s cooldown

# Damage

## GCD

**Glare III**

* At lower levels you'll have Stone, which gets replaced by Glare at level 72
* Single target damage (310), 1.5 cast time
* Can weave 1 oGCD after it
* Cast this when you don't need to do anything else.


**Holy III**

* Aoe damage in a small 8y radius around you (150p), 2.5s cast time
* Holy is a gain over Glare 3 on 3 targets
* In non boss fights Holy has a stun that gets reduced each time time starting off with 4s stun followed by 2s stun and the last stun being 1s.
* Holy is your strongest tool in Dungeons letting you have an effective 7 second stun

**Dia**

* At lower levels you'll have Aero which has a lower duration(18s), this is replaced by Dia at level 72
* Single target damage (60p) and DoT (10 ticks of 60p), instant cast
* Total Potency: 660
* In dungeons, apply dia while running and spam holy when the tank stops
* If Optimizing: 
         * Refreshing Dia early can be a gain if you know your kill/phase time and you know you will lose ticks anyway.
         * Dia is a gain on Glare III after 5 ticks.

**Afflatus Misery**

* AoE damage in a very small 5y radius around enemy target (900p), instant cast
* Deals 25% less damage to enemies that aren't the main target in a 5y radius
* Misery can only be activated if you have a blood Lily 
* You gain Blood Lily charges when using a Lily charge, you need three lily usages to gain a Blood Lily.
* Using Three Lily and Misery is a dps lost compared to 4 Glares on one target.
* Three Lillies and misery is a dps gain on 2+ target, be aware of its small 5y radius and make sure it is hitting two targets. 
* If you have 2 stacks for Blood Lily it's a gain to use an extra Lily heal and  blood Lily before the fight ends. Aim to put it in raid buffs to get more value from it.

## OGCD

**Assize 45s cd**

* AoE damage in a 15y radius around you (400p) and an AoE heal in a 15y radius around you (400p)
* Should be used as a damage spell so it should be used on cooldown unless you know you will not lose a use delaying it.
* Try to delay your own healing if Assize will be coming off of cooldown before  threatening damage. This will allow you to use Assize for both damage and healing
* Losing a use of assize on one target is okay if you'll hit 2 or more targets. Losing an Assize is optimal if it means you'll hit 3+ targets 

# Healing

## GCD

**Cure**

* Single target heal (500p), 1.5s cast time
* Can weave 1 oGCD after this
* Cure should not be used in almost every situation unless you're out of mana and it's your only heal

**Cure II**

* Single target heal (800p), 2.0s cast time
* Use in Niche scenarios where you need a single target heal, and you ran out of Afflatus Solace, Tetragrammaton, Benediction and it's too late to use Regen

**Afflatus Solace**

* Single target heal (800p), instant cast
* Use in most scenarios over cure 2 as Misery can refund some of the lost potency

**Regen**

* Single target strong regen (6 ticks of 250p)
* Total heal: 1,500
* Regen is preferential to Cure 2 if you don't need immediate healing

**Medica**

* Aoe Heal in a 15y radius around you (400p), 2s cast time
* Use in niche Scenarios where you need extra aoe healing and you can't wait for a tick of  Medica 2 and you have no Lillies.

**Medica 2**

* AoE heal in a 20y radius around you (250p) and regen (5 ticks of 150p)
* Total healing: 1,000p
* Medica 2 is equal to Medica if you can wait for one tick of healing
*  Use in scenarios where you need an AoE GCD heals, use this over Medica  as it becomes neutral to Medica with one regen tick and a heal gain with at least two ticks.

**Cure 3**

* AoE heal in a very small 6y Radius around your ally target (600p), 2s cast time
* Use in situations where you need a big burst heal in one gcd. 
* Make sure people are grouped tight because it only has a 6y radius

**Afflatus Rapture **

*AoE heal in a 20y radius around you (400p), instant cast
* Use over Medica as Misery can refund some of the lost potency 


## oGCD

**Divine Benison 30s cd**
