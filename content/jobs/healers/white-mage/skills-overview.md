# **Damage**

## **GCD**

![Glare III](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002646_hr1.png)

### **Glare III**

* Single target damage (310), 1.5 cast time
* At lower levels you'll have Stone, which gets replaced by Glare at level 72
* Can weave one oGCD after it
* Cast this when you don't need to do anything else.

![Holy III](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002647_hr1.png)

### **Holy III**

* AoE damage in a small 8y radius around you (150p), 2.5s cast time
* In non boss fights, Holy has a stun that gets reduced each time starting off with 4s stun followed by 2s stun and the last stun being 1s.
* Holy is your strongest tool in Dungeons, letting you have an effective seven second stun
* Holy is a gain over Glare III on three targets
* Try to use Swift before Holy in dungeon runs before the first usage, makes the stun chain smooth

![Dia](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002641_hr1.png)

### **Dia**

* Single target damage (65p) and DoT (10 ticks of 65p), instant cast. Total Potency: 660
* At lower levels you'll have Aero, this is replaced by Dia at level 72
* In dungeons, apply Dia while running and spam Holy when the tank stops
* If Optimizing: 

  * Refreshing Dia early can be a gain if you know your kill/phase time and you know you will lose ticks anyway. 
  * Dia is a gain on Glare III after five ticks.

![Afflatus Misery](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002644_hr1.png)

### **Afflatus Misery**

* AoE damage in a very small 5y radius around enemy target (1,240p), instant cast. Deals 620 potency to enemies that aren’t the main target in a 5y radius. 
* You gain Blood Lily charges when using a Lily charge, you need three lily usages to gain a Blood Lily. Misery can only be activated if you have a Blood Lily
* Three Lilies and a Misery is a DPS gain on two or more targets. Be aware of its small 5y radius and make sure it is hitting two targets.
* Your priority for Misery should be Movement if you have nothing else > Using it into Putting it into raid buffs > before the fight ends
* If you have at least one Blood Lily charge, it's a gain to use as many Lilies as you need to get a Blood Lily before the fight ends.

## **oGCD**

![Assize](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002634_hr1.png)

### **Assize (40s CD)**

* AoE damage in a 15y radius around you (400p) and an AoE heal in a 15y radius around you (400p)
* Should  always be used on cooldown for damage.
* Try to delay your own healing or communicate with your cohealer if Assize will be coming off of cooldown before threatening damage. This will allow you to use Assize for both damage and healing
* Delaying Assize to heal can be done if you know you won’t lose a use
* Excellent ability for cleave damage, always a gain to delay if you can hit more than two targets

# Healing

### **Cure II**

* Single target heal (800p), 2.0s cast time, 1000 MP cost

### **Afflatus Solace**

* Single target heal (800p), instant cast

* After 20s Bell expires and any remaining stacks heal allies within a 20y radius (200p per stack)

* Grants Confession to allies within a 20y radius

## **Other Actions**

![Temperance](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002645_hr1.png)

### **Temperance (2m CD - oGCD)**

* Grants Temperance a 20s buff that increases your GCD healing by 20% and gives a 10% mitigation to allies within a 50y radius.

* In dungeons use on both trash and bosses, do not save it unless trash will die soon
