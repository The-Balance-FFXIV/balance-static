  - question: How should movement and weaving be handled?
    answer: >-
      White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so
      planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available
      options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter
      and your party.


      1. Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes

      2. Natural Dia refresh (< ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog)

      3. Rapture that does useful healing, Misery

      4. Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below)

      5. Overheal Lilies

      6. Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable)


      Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.


      Useful healing in this context means healing that cannot be covered by your or another healer’s oGCDs.
  - question: How do I use lilies?
    answer: "Lilies are a damage loss on single target as Misery is 900p and takes
      four GCDs, four Glare IIIs is 1240p. Thus, Lilies should only be used for
      healing that oGCDs cannot cover, or for extended movement that you cannot
      slidecast and don't have a Dia refresh or Swiftcast for.\ 


      Glare > Glare > Glare > Glare = 4 GCDs for 1240p\\

      Rapture > Rapture > Rapture > Misery = 4 GCDs for 900p


      Lilies should be used in downtime whenever possible as they are free
      potency gains.  If Misery can be used to cleave any additional targets,
      then Lilies become a damage gain, but should still be used in downtime
      when possible.\r


      \n"
  - question: Why are PoM and Assize used later in the opener?
    answer: Presence of Mind and Assize are held until 3rd/4th GCD raid buffs to
      maximize damage under raid buffs like Trick Attack, however they can be
      used earlier if you end up losing a cast or can get better alignment with
      add phases, etc.
  - question: How do I heal dungeons?
    answer: >-
      Your dungeon priority isn't terribly different from your typical damage
      priority, in general you'll  Regen and Divine Benison to keep the tank
      healthy while gathering mobs, Dia on multiple mobs while running, drop
      Asylum where tank will be stopping, and Holy III once the tank has
      stopped. 


      Holy III still has a full 2.5s cast so weaving additional mitigation and healing is typically done via Solace or Regen once the tank starts taking damage. Lilies should be used between packs as often as possible to maximize Misery and Holy casts on larger pulls.

# White Mage FAQ

# How should movement and weaving be handled?

White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.

1. Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes
2. Natural Dia refresh (< ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog)
3. Rapture that does useful healing, Misery
4. Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below)
5. Overheal Lilies
6. Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable)

Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.

Useful healing in this context means healing that cannot be covered by you or another healer’s OGCDs.

# Afflatus FAQ

## Should Afflatus Misery be used every 90s?

No. Building Blood Lily stacks and using Afflatus Misery is a loss over rolling Glare casts.

Glare > Glare > Glare > Glare = 4 GCDs for 1200p\
Rapture > Rapture > Rapture > Misery = 4 GCDs for 900p

## When should Afflatus heals be used?

For a simple and easy-to-remember rule of thumb for Lilies, try to get it to do two of the following three things:

1. Needed effective healing
2. Weaving oGCDs (bonus points for double weaving!)
3. Movement
4. Downtime

Which doesn’t mean “don’t use Lilies if you don’t meet two of these” (especially if one is the heal!) - but do try to. What will actually be optimal in any given moment will likely come down to encounter specific rotations anyways. **It is perfectly fine to sit on three Lilies if you haven’t needed them for one of the above reasons**.

## Afflatus as a mechanic is an all-or-nothing thing!

The DPS benefits of Afflatus heals go down the drain if you never get the Misery off. If you don’t use the Misery, All Afflatus casts become just like standard GCD heals.

However, you can and should sit on Misery for any of the following uses as the fight allows for:

* Weave window for oGCDs
* Movement window for mechanics
* Raid buff alignment windows for extra damage return
* You want to use an Afflatus heal and will get off another Misery over the course of a fight.

## Should Afflatus heals be prioritized over other healing spells?

Reach for Afflatus heals before other GCD heals like Cure II and Cure III. Afflatus heals vs. oGCD heals will depend on how much healing potency you need, and if you’re going to clip to apply them.
