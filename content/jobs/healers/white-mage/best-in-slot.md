    description: This set is identical to the 6.2 Mid-Piety Set but swaps most of
      the DH melds to Det.

    description: This set has a bit faster SpS to help with slidecasting Panto, this
      in combination with the DoT refresh and Lillies makes Panto extremely
      comfy for WHM.

  - type: etro
    description: This is the slowest of the 3 Min-Piety BiS sets, its higher GCD may
      be more comfortable for those on higher ping. This set also has the
      highest DHit for those looking to farm Crit/DHit runs. Unlike the other
      sets, this set uses Carrot Pudding as it's preferred food. Min-piety sets
      are only designed for use in controlled environments with minimal GCD
      healing and raising.

  - type: etro
    description: This set offers is mostly identical to the 2.42 min-piety set but
      has slightly more spellspeed, slightly lower DHit, and uses Garlean Pizza
      instead of Carrot Pudding, but the expected damage is the same. This set
      is identical to the 2.40 SCH BiS for more comfortable job swapping.
      Min-piety sets are only designed for use in controlled environments with
      minimal GCD healing and raising.

  - type: etro
    description: This set is considerably faster than the other min-piety sets and
      has the lowest DHit. This set has the least PoM drift of the BiS sets, but
      the lowest amount of DHit. Its expected damage is still identical to the
      other min-piety sets. Min-piety sets are only designed for use in
      controlled environments with minimal GCD healing and raising.

  - type: etro
    description: This set sacrifices a tiny bit of damage for slightly more piety.
      It offers a bit more leeway with GCD healing and raising, but not enough
      for constant raising and deaths.
    name: 2.42 GCD Low-Piety
    link: https://etro.gg/gearset/a7cb866f-6a5f-4744-b682-dddba4339143
  - type: etro
    description: This set is a fantastic set for all content as it has enough piety
      for substantial amounts of GCD heals or recovery from death. It does have
      the least damage of the listed sets as is expected for higher-piety sets.

    link: https://etro.gg/gearset/e2fc82de-9629-48fd-ad46-5b13be00aaba
  - type: etro
    description: This is a higher piety set aimed for people progging for the first
      time especially if you are running the 233 P7 strat which requires
      substantially more GCD healing. This set also gives more wiggle room for
      raises. You can addd or remove piety melds as you progress, or look to one
      of the higher damage sets.

  - type: etro
    description: This is a higher damage set mostly aimed at people running the 611
      P7 strategy or for reclears. This set should be avoided if you are
      progging and using a 233 P7 strat.

      ## TEA / UWU / UCOB


      Synced down gear is your best bet for old ultimates as they will cap both substats and max out your mind and vit. The biggest gear upgrade **by far** is the 515 or 535 Shadowbringers relic, as you can cap multiple substats, but again they are hardly required.  I personally recommend 3+ piety pieces for prog, with your remaining gear prioritizing Crit > Det/SpS wherever possible, and you can always swap the piety slots to higher damage gear if you don't find yourself having MP issues.  Don't worry about getting perfect stats, they won't make a difference for anything but rank one.


      ### **The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)**


      Gear at item level 595 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 184 Crit/Det, 100 SpS/Piety


      ### The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)


      Gear at item level 500 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 136 Crit/Det/SpS, 60 Piety


      ### The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCOB)


      Gear at item level 470 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 127 Crit/Det/SpS, 87 Piety

    description: "Disclaimer: MP uptime on the sheet is higher than in reality, for
      example the recommended low-piety sets appears to run out of mana around
      ~9:30 where sheet says 13:06. The speed sets listed in this calc run out
      of mana before most average parties can kill bosses, so they should
      absolutely only be used in organized speed runs if you are positive you
      can get away with the mp drain. You can check it out
