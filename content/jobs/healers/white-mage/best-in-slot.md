    description: This is the slowest of the 3 Min-Piety BiS sets, its higher GCD may
      be more comfortable for those on higher ping. This set also has the
      highest DHit for those looking to farm Crit/DHit runs. Unlike the other
      sets, this set uses Carrot Pudding as it's preferred food. Min-piety sets
      are only designed for use in controlled environments with minimal GCD
      healing and raising.

    description: This set offers is mostly identical to the 2.42 min-piety set but
      has slightly more spellspeed, slightly lower DHit, and uses Garlean Pizza
      instead of Carrot Pudding, but the expected damage is the same. This set
      is identical to the 2.40 SCH BiS for more comfortable job swapping.

    description: This set is considerably faster than the other min-piety sets and
      has the lowest DHit. This set has the least PoM drift of the BiS sets, but
      the lowest amount of DHit. Its expected damage is still identical to the
      other min-piety sets. Min-piety sets are only designed for use in
      controlled environments with minimal GCD healing and raising.

    description: This set sacrifices a tiny bit of damage for slightly more piety.
      It offers a bit more leeway with GCD healing and raising, but not enough
      for constant raising and deaths.

    description: This set is a fantastic set for all content as it has enough piety
      for substantial amounts of GCD heals or recovery from death. It does have
      the least damage of the listed sets as is expected for higher-piety sets.

      enough MP to cover most prog situations.

      cannot go wrong with this set.

      ## TEA Prog set (linked)


      2.42 GCD | 1364 Piety\

      Flexible set able to accommodate a wide range of Piety levels and two different GCDs. Standard setup uses Smoked Chicken for 2.42, you can use Twilight Popoto Salad for 2.41 or Golden Pineapple Juice for some extra Piety. You can put Piety instead of Det on Relic if desired (in any amount you want) and the Piety melds can be stripped out for Det/DH if you feel you want to go lower. (Existing Det melds can be swapped to DH too).  


      **Edenmorn Chest is BiS, use 520 Nier or Augmented Deepshadow otherwise.**  


      **TL;DR: Use this as a starting point and adjust to comfort.**


      ## UWU / UCOB


      The damage checks in UWU and UCOB are trivial with current gear, food and potions. The biggest gear upgrade **by far** is the 515 or 535 relic, as you can cap multiple substats, but again they are hardly required.  I personally recommend 1k+ Piety for prog, with your remaining gear prioritizing Crit > Det/SpS wherever possible.  Don't worry about getting perfect stats, they won't make a difference for anything but rank one.


      ### The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)


      Gear at item level 470 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 318 Crit, 318 Det, 318 SpS, 213+ Piety


      ### The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCOB)


      Gear at item level 418 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 280 Crit/Det/SpS/Piety

    description: "Disclaimer: MP uptime on the sheet is higher than in reality, for
      example the recommended low-piety sets appears to run out of mana around
      ~9:30 where sheet says 13:06. The speed sets listed in this calc run out
      of mana before most average parties can kill bosses, so they should
      absolutely only be used in organized speed runs if you are positive you
      can get away with the mp drain. You can check it out
