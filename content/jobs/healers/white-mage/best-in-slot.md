    description: Descriptions for both sets can be found in the sheet. These are
      sets that are utilizing all 730 gear. While sacrificing a very small
      amount of damage compared to the other sets, they are still extremely
      useful for both reclears and should be used for ultimate prog. **PLEASE DO
      NOT GO INTO ULTIMATE PROG WITHOUT MAX ITEM LEVEL**

    name: " Full Comprehensive Set List"
    description: These sets have no descriptions, and most people should never worry
      about them. They only exist if someone wants to know every absolute
      gearing option.
