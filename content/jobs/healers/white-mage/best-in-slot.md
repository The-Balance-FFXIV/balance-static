    description: Descriptions for all sets individually can be found in the sheet.
      As a general rule these sets sacrifice the higher vitality from 730 gear
      in return for damage gains gotten from 710 pieces of gear.

    name: Max Item Level Gear Sets
    description: Descriptions for both sets can be found in the sheet. These are
      sets that are utilizing all 730 gear. While sacrificing a very small
      amount of damage compared to the other sets, they are still extremely
      useful for both reclears and should be used for ultimate prog. **PLEASE DO
      NOT GO INTO ULTIMATE PROG WITHOUT MAX ITEM LEVEL**

    description: These sets have no descriptions, and most people should never worry
      about them. They only exist if someone wants to know every absolute
      gearing option.
