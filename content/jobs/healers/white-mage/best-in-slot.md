    description: >-
      Descriptions for both sets can be found in the sheet. These are sets that
      are utilizing all 730 gear. While sacrificing a very small amount of
      damage compared to the other sets, they are still extremely useful for
      both reclears and should be used for ultimate prog. These are also the
      best sets for max item level without using Chaotic gear. **PLEASE DO NOT
      GO INTO ULTIMATE PROG WITHOUT MAX ITEM LEVEL, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT IF YOURE
      GOING FOR MAX DPS CHAOTIC GETS YOU MAX ITEM LEVEL AS WELL

    description: These sets have no descriptions, and most people should never worry
      about them. They only exist if someone wants to know every absolute
      gearing option.
