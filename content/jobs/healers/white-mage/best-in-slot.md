      Important Note: SPS sims highest, but if you are looking for more variance
      (parsing), the slower sets begin to pull ahead at higher standard
      deviations. Basically they have more variability, so if you want higher
      highs and lower lows, slow sets are better, if you want consistent dps,
      the faster set is better for double tome.


      Compared to other healers WHM is fairly impartial to GCD, if you frequently play other healers I would recommend using their sets in place of WHM-specific sets.

      Option A - Tome Chest + Wrist + Ring: 


      On track to final BiS. No tomes "wasted" 


      Lower damage but naturally has higher Piety which has value in prog 


      Option B - Tome Chest + Wrist + Earrings: 


      Diverts 375 tomes to earrings which may not be part of the final BiS (This depends on which set youre using, 2.41 runs tome earrings) 


      Higher damage (~0.3-0.9% depending on choice of Piety and GCD speed)
