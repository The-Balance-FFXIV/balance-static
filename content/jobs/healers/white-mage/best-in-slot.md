      2.50 GCD | 719 Piety


      This set uses the raid neck to maintain a comfy level of Piety while running the slowest possible GCD without sacrificing significant damage.  This set should be sufficient for enrage kills and the occasional raise or GCD heal outside Thin Air.

      2.48 GCD | 592 Piety


      This set forgoes some Piety from the recommended set to go marginally faster for more damage.  It has lower uptime than the above set so is not recommended in any content where you may need to GCD heal or raise outside Thin Air, although may get more mileage in fights where Lilies are needed for either damage or movement.

      2.45 GCD | 479 Piety


      This set swaps the raid hat to the tome hat for another small damage gain at the cost of Piety.  This set (and other speedkill sets) will run dry on longer kills even without GCD heals or raises so is only recommended in organized environments where you are assured a short kill time. There are even riskier speed sets listed in the gear calc but the gains past this set are minimal.

      ## TEA Prog set (linked)


      2.42 GCD | 1364 Piety\

      Flexible set able to accommodate a wide range of Piety levels and two different GCDs. Standard setup uses Smoked Chicken for 2.42, you can use Twilight Popoto Salad for 2.41 or Golden Pineapple Juice for some extra Piety. You can put Piety instead of Det on Relic if desired (in any amount you want) and the Piety melds can be stripped out for Det/DH if you feel you want to go lower. (Existing Det melds can be swapped to DH too).  


      **Edenmorn Chest is BiS, use 520 Nier or Augmented Deepshadow otherwise.**  


      **TL;DR: Use this as a starting point and adjust to comfort.**


      ## UWU / UCOB


      The damage checks in UWU and UCOB are trivial with current gear, food and potions. The biggest gear upgrade **by far** is the 515 or 535 relic, as you can cap multiple substats, but again they are hardly required.  I personally recommend 1k+ Piety for prog, with your remaining gear prioritizing Crit > Det/SpS wherever possible.  Don't worry about getting perfect stats, they won't make a difference for anything but rank one.


      ### The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)


      Gear at item level 470 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 318 Crit, 318 Det, 318 SpS, 213+ Piety


      ### The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCOB)


      Gear at item level 418 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 280 Crit/Det/SpS/Piety

    description: "Disclaimer: MP uptime on the sheet is higher than in reality, for
      example the recommended low-piety sets appears to run out of mana around
      ~9:30 where sheet says 13:06. The speed sets listed in this calc run out
      of mana before most average parties can kill bosses, so they should
      absolutely only be used in organized speed runs if you are positive you
      can get away with the mp drain."
