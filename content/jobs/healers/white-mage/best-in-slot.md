      This set has plenty of piety to handle extra deaths and raises and is always a good option, though it lacks some of the damage of the sets below.

      has much higher DHit for crit farming. AST/SCH 2.32 sps set is also a good
      option.

      ## TEA Prog set (linked)


      2.42 GCD | 1364 Piety\

      Flexible set able to accommodate a wide range of Piety levels and two different GCDs. Standard setup uses Smoked Chicken for 2.42, you can use Twilight Popoto Salad for 2.41 or Golden Pineapple Juice for some extra Piety. You can put Piety instead of Det on Relic if desired (in any amount you want) and the Piety melds can be stripped out for Det/DH if you feel you want to go lower. (Existing Det melds can be swapped to DH too).  


      **Edenmorn Chest is BiS, use 520 Nier or Augmented Deepshadow otherwise.**  


      **TL;DR: Use this as a starting point and adjust to comfort.**


      ## UWU / UCOB


      The damage checks in UWU and UCOB are trivial with current gear, food and potions. The biggest gear upgrade **by far** is the 515 or 535 relic, as you can cap multiple substats, but again they are hardly required.  I personally recommend 1k+ Piety for prog, with your remaining gear prioritizing Crit > Det/SpS wherever possible.  Don't worry about getting perfect stats, they won't make a difference for anything but rank one.


      ### The Weapon's Refrain (UWU)


      Gear at item level 470 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 318 Crit, 318 Det, 318 SpS, 213+ Piety


      ### The Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCOB)


      Gear at item level 418 and above will cap both substats.\

      Relic stats: 280 Crit/Det/SpS/Piety

    description: "Disclaimer: MP uptime on the sheet is higher than in reality, for
      example the recommended low-piety sets appears to run out of mana around
      ~9:30 where sheet says 13:06. The speed sets listed in this calc run out
      of mana before most average parties can kill bosses, so they should
      absolutely only be used in organized speed runs if you are positive you
      can get away with the mp drain."
