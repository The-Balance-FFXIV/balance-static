# The Walter White Mage Leveling Guide

## Written by Eva Izunia (Goblin)

Leveling White Mage allows you access to some of the smoothest dungeon runs in the game, due to the supremely high damage output when crowd controlling enemy groups and the nature of the job in general.

*But to get there, you first must begin on the road.*

Unlocking White Mage is done upon reaching level 30 with the Conjurer class and completing the quest Seer Folly after completing the MSQ quest Sylph-management.

# Words of Note

Playing a Healer in Final Fantasy XIV is different than what you’d expect in many similar games. Ideally, you want to be doing *as much **damage** as possible, and as little **healing** as possible.* The damage of White Mage is generally extremely high (especially later with a spell learned at level 45!)

**White Mage** is what’s known as a “Regen" or "Pure” Healer, meaning most of their healing either comes from regenerative ('regen') abilities, or direct healing from their spells.

The other “Pure” healer would be Astrologian (as of Patch 6.0), who also relies on direct regen/pure healing, unlike the “Shield” healers of Scholar and Sage, who rely on preventing damage from happening in the first place.

One thing that should be important to note as a healer is that **you will generally not be healing everyone at the same time.** In normal content, most of the damage will be going to one person, and one person only (the tank) and ideally, only in cases where an attack comes out that hits every person will you need to divert your attention away from your tank.

## General Leveling Tips

Leveling from 1 - 80 in FFXIV can be daunting at first, but as long as you understand that you will not be able to level to max in one day, and keep at it at your own pace; you should get by just fine.

Sources of EXP can usually be broken into four categories.

* **Repeatable** - Can be repeated ad infinitum every single day, as many times as you wish per day.
* **Daily** - Can be done once per day, and generally give a decent amount of EXP. These can be your roulettes. Standout roulettes include Main Scenario (Level 50) & your PvP-oriented Frontline (Level 30). These roulettes can give an incredibly large amount of EXP, oftentimes giving half of a level each.
* **Weekly** - These, as the name implies, reset every week and usually give the greatest amount of EXP possible. Standouts include Wondrous Tales and the Challenge Log. These combined can both give an entire level (and then some) depending on your current Armory Bonus, level, buffs, etc.
* **One-time** - These EXP sources are once and you’re done deals, meaning if you complete them on one job, you will not be able to do them again. Standouts include the MSQ and Sidequests. The MSQ itself will easily level you to 80 as long as you follow it with the job of your choosing all the way through.

Some things to help you along are buffs you can apply.

* **Free Companies:** can give out *The Heat of Battle I/II*, which increases your EXP gain from killing monsters by 15%.
* **Food:** Buffs will increase EXP earned by 3%.
* **The Road to 70:** will increase EXP earned by 100% if you created your character on a preferred world, and 90 days have not elapsed since the creation of your character.
* **Armory Bonus:** (100%) applies when you have a job over the current level of whatever you are playing at that very moment. So, for instance, a level 32 White Mage will gain more EXP if you also have a level 57 Red Mage.

# Level 1 to 30

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x8z6Klh7w5Mb2PscrKUh7i_FbVlBmAwz17S7EdV-K1cQr9CliqmGPGd2SNAXsZZvx7aU0B5jWKR_1CyAT6k2u3MpfGQ8DT9DNf0Cc14DNu7aF3e4j8X_xIEqsYWtUzfE4tlainXd)

## Skills & Spells (1 to 30)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DU4dG8VZl2nY2XpQYruHQG2ChmH6TuGVtGFWxznsQZuSf7OPCq_hnDSMxkQXAhaRmYTXsQuX0DEIOukI5QzmWjvGPo9wsvq6e0l0CKqYp7yUCbKMcJ4H_iHiTm6zxNyiS3QQxNXD)

At first, you will be limited to a very basic set of skills, including; 

**\[Lvl 1] Stone**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PisB7SR2VeWqGUj1WPc-EEzg7FhXtXt2ZSBAjJFnCSbuHUDo4flVXB9btiGMgmtIGHjCW54TFlidZgrWq1gB84T6dJF85rhlUSlyFdSMHMzLEPg72OInFgaGoxWoHsLo6H00fb6D)

Stone is your main filler spell for whenever you’re not casting anything else. You use Stone (or whatever variant you may have at your level) to deal damage to enemies.

**\[Lvl 2] Cure**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2yt9_1puY_elz5Bokt6A-hw0R7O9FhtKhQ6nV6sLM_pD3IMki9K3gCGPrYwutOgX8pK3hbmSGUV--4AnjCKITN4cnuPDTyU53ZHe2XOA6A-SgjSTb8oE3LQHnNn_cAkwyCuW09I8)

Cure is as simple as it gets. One cast of this spell will heal your current target. Obviously, you use this spell whenever someone (or you) is in need of healing. It has a secondary effect which we will get into later.

Please keep one thing in mind with this ability.

This ability WILL BE replaced upon reaching level 30. Do not get comfortable with it.

**\[Lvl 4] Aero**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cg_j1DRChjIHXxPs_xyZpE0XUOb8422qtTw0SU9VLIvbNDgNLmK7Uqezxa_o6W7oRgSxTpEYkU6tP-DZX80v-sQF0E_ESe4eNhmpdHq-KJSozM1blWC_9tuTs2i1bKy4X4mm9TrO)

Aero places a Damage over Time (henceforth known as a DoT) on the target for 18 seconds, dealing 30 potency for each “tick*” of the damage inflicted.

You want to keep this spell active on your enemy target at all times, recasting it every 15 or so seconds.

\* (DoT ticks happen every 3 seconds.)

**\[Lvl 8] Repose**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F0XlyBwHmOYpd57IaOlqYZ90ipnk8ZhC_AdPFk8IelAASS-tZWF9Wj29kyUbxl5cC0cp1ZT77KJxUa3C2FAm4kTMh8lMFYuFDSvNZxnTw3TwDRugMyW1nG6uioOWNIFBIMGvck1f)

Repose is very, very seldom used, and is shared across all healers in the game. This spell simply puts your target to sleep. Keep in mind however, that after 30 seconds, they will wake up and attack you. They will also attack if they take any damage. For this reason, there is rarely a scenario where this spell will be useful.

**\[Lvl 10] Esuna**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qp4ILpgOzwpWggz7AGBiVC4cs46vPs2u9vhYvAB9pP-un9wU0vXt-vEef1l5venu1XACqovwqLmBE1rQVDyhg_WDtKjSyEX6Xr7UknOmUWo5x8eEfetRHY7IOba_v1zr966YXK_G)

Esuna is another spell that is shared across all healers, and it acts as a debuff removal tool. 

Whenever a player is inflicted with a debuff (like poison), use Esuna to get rid of their debuff, and to save yourself a headache.

Keep in mind, only specific debuffs can be removed. These are indicated by a blue line above the icon for the debuff: ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/O1pQAkS_r_9cOvrG3mf167TQ0I3_mahq9_-HVx28qkhiX9cWCBdanJuEVTJwlUXBKg1JnA-exHYP_Bl_LkGECLf-gID-ebp1Wzg-DfgGBMT7xjatfVsnVTVSTvAmUDZmYCxl3u8h)

**\[Lvl 10] Medica**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iwhV5ImSff3XlquKIgNTQ6HvP0b44JoZPTNHfVDOk7uxRICEt3QJhtN8UgoGmnnsiujH0n_U2AZ6CZK4VAb9HZ33jawa60beQcxDPHj2nB8VmegDsKYSJiz9eXCb4JcdahElzDbK)

Medica is your first Area of Effect heal (henceforth known as AoE) that heals for slightly less than Cure, but affects you and everyone around you in a 15 yalm radius. 

**\[Lvl 12] Raise**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/u3pnNeT8S-nnw5XYUogZh5MQ3xjsUiki6uoFHlkd6f0V6pnbDY0L5_lKYvFY_Y2vOROT5GDt7PuT0h9Z_ox1LT9tK6qy-0Hi-4TRzGNJNbjLgm5WpYeRldKqCyaQFb9aI-eU0qN4)

Raise has an incredibly long cast time, but revives your currently selected target from the dead, allowing them to fight once more.

One should note however that when the player returns to life, they will be at low HP, so healing them should be a relatively high priority so they don’t die immediately after.

**\[Lvl 15] Fluid Aura**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tCHkYrlDxTl2rcZ2gSX64Xv9K4ydxcfs0XaI4ZG_Xs58DE7TEuCa2DnAPke0EwJxWMW3LwdZfhjVaYLghMtl2JPFFovKNc6YoBp6jzM0sfdQvlbI5ghPfq2eYNvo86vZvZHcXbyj)

Fluid Aura should be removed from your hotbar.

**\[Lvl 18] Stone II**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2K00JIMc1xvw31cky-aZ8VMhNV4-gOHELDuTQx6h6buGnY2DA7P0x18EQUtrzkRDVBj1u-qZHhgFJoxx6HiH4oTjdtN5bRP_hG4LUuOFyBVLMxvBzzlSvX1hwTzXKP76lMAmn2G9)

Stone II is a direct upgrade from the previous “Stone” and simply does more damage. Use it the same way you would use Stone.

**\[Lvl 18] Swiftcast**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aIJNQ9jIOLFWqFZ2NAimzyUQxbWGOzb9WP7FktkEAjshrLmrjIYJlM-MJnR3ppUiiMUl0tcN692AdZIKkEzw_ZHxSRoJWBLBmbkN3aDjrb9FSmAkmsg_cbnGTHdW8LjSaSkiHqIk)

Swiftcast is shared across all casters in the game, and simply makes the next spell you cast have no cast time (instant). Typically, you want to save this for emergency scenarios, such as reviving a player using Raise or as a last resort for when you need an extra bit of healing with a Cure.

**\[Lvl 24] Lucid Dreaming**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DAZhQ_ZRxH8u3Ef_faA50TqOl-aSgehIz6RTKmYO1Nar1EA3pc7D_DXaMF05kGnfFXCP5uE7lLUiQTBHN0WiLnDB5VJSKBdn0FHPqU3m0KaYK1XlWGVUz7UEj2m-yshDFqJRENk8)

Lucid Dreaming is another spell shared by all casters in game, and it restores your MP by a potency of 50 for 21 seconds each time it ticks.

Typically, you want to use this when your MP is at 8500 as to avoid bottoming out your MP, and leading to situations where you can’t heal because you’ve used up all your MP.

## Conjurer Rotation and Leveling (1 to 30)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kjmfCL4T7PnSAiNYOPbOUc1TSxlrUK2aPR_eaDC9RwewARYjJPBXb0PLt61iZGAX_chSeamSowDLAF7vFvyH3D8CtNilxI24kazDzb2oshmrZqKEmWcS_8Y1xPkSqIESkiV7mnCF)

To begin, your gameplay will be *extremely* bare bones and basic, and you should be focusing on casting Aero every ~15 seconds to refresh the damage over time effect, continuously casting Stone for your damage and casting Cure whenever health totals are dropping.

**A word of note however**; one common pitfall of healing in Final Fantasy XIV is the mindset of keeping everyone at 100% HP at all times. 

**Do not do this.** There is no need to keep everyone completely healed at all times, the sole requirement is to keep everyone alive. However, do not take this as a go-ahead to play limbo with your health totals, as this will lead to many fumbles in the future.

*Keep calm* and just keep an eye on your party’s (or your own) HP.

When it comes to leveling in general, for your first class/job, it’s imperative that you do your Main Scenario Quests, as the EXP these give you will easily level you from 1 - 80 doing them alone.

That said, and this goes for every block of leveling; spamming your highest level dungeon is usually the best way to gain the most EXP if you’re out of dailies/weeklies to do. (As of patch 5.58, this may change with the release of Endwalker).

# Level 30 - 50

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/np_Xe0aW5KxBFi8ny7HROHT-H1eL-nbOrC1ETa4Y2JLUZFarp47aNgUZIlJbDzScSFlTkpHio_BDaXaJtpp6ENmxb6MNLoXp01N3EVlOZ9T9a_MkPenyDEzSpJ3pZ3nlh2GveXea)

Upon reaching level 30 and completing the quests mentioned above, you will finally unlock the job **White Mage.** Upon completing the quest prior, you will unlock your new spell Cure II, which we will get into.

From 30 to 50, White Mage changes a great deal, and it can be daunting at times to understand it all. 

This guide acts as a way to get you started before you lose your mind leveling. 

## Skills and Spells (30 - 50)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5yuHHLi0jZLMztw46nRTuURDX9gjtNi87A51eAM2OjL3JzhhWuV-oVoogLBkhuifP_0KjDqePy2QD2HqRccLIMl8Ia6hOTYVuUKSGFGZ_M2a1PUOx_ls7wF5Y_jLVKmf2xYlZdOt)

White Mage truly opens its kit starting from 30, and it will only continue to expand from there. However, some skills become a bread & butter of your playstyle and that can help immensely in learning the class.

First off, let’s go over your new skills.

**\[Lvl 30] Cure II**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4KcJJZeEF9Tlq4rdkHHFz2AI39pXrjljr3jJnoV_uYbqrH91uyyKjLyl6O5jcBRb2Aiy_Z9BqjgqBLdNGv_48QdFEkNvMQV39ysFv3ZRioDpBRyvZejfb5Ms4oX3O7B2wOioFmLr)

For the sake of all that is holy, please ALWAYS cast Cure II for your single target healing. At level 32, you unlock a trait called Freecure, which gives a 15% chance to proc a free use of Cure II after casting Cure.

This is not worth it. Cure II should ALWAYS be your go-to healing spell once you’re above level 30. Freecure is a trap, an evil trap to bait new healers and prevent them from having their healing output be useful.

What may arise, however, as Cure is 400 MP and Cure II is 1000, is that you may have an MP deficit. This can be easily solved by slowing down your healing. Remember that as long as your party isn’t dead, everything is fine. 

To reiterate, please use Cure II instead of Cure for almost all scenarios. 

**\[Lvl 30] Presence of Mind**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5vylxKrqc2c9uKOukqIJQ6vapIum9EwgpSGme9rM5jet15TErxlYqxysigXrgkvVqesnFnghYkp0Yw6pFoSGnr1LIGWif0XetXumOYMGgQ6mhIE-SWnPxd0m_Zto46MdPRwDvxkB)

Presence of Mind is your first exclusive WHM ability and it acts as an accelerator for all of your spells. Presence of Mind allows you to do damage, heal, and generally execute all your abilities 20% faster.

**\[Lvl 35] Regen**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LlQCTUXWvO985IU-1PFC2BS8QWTikWoI0INgyzhaCvD2WRb43-hnzAgna2uW6_rHiV155VDOyoYCZ1e-38OWLazDTPO1au8qnRCKwqlVz2x9gCbonCnHI_9DaCyY4bWQQN79FK3l)

Regen is amazing. Placing this spell on your Tank during dungeons can almost single-handedly heal them, that’s just how good it is.

Regen heals for a cure potency of 200 every 3 seconds. Combine this with a general upkeep of casting Cure II whenever your Tank does take enough damage and it’s nigh unstoppable.

**\[Lvl 40] Cure III**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WBBKXfAPEABWMK1VfJ4mKcpu-X4lr5ofRHyyGSrwER0NUnehHYtmC5--r1F4rgGKr4o8FNoI_K2clMY1JyASskP2ox2m6sSD04YXkx677egtQj0CdwrJq694lGwDyP2ugFnc3dRx)

Cure III may at first lead you to believe there is a pattern, but no.

Cure III acts as your best AoE heal for when your group is clumped together, with a massive cure potency of 550. The downside to this is the absolutely its tiny range.

This spell is best used during stack mechanics, where all of your party must stick together to mitigate a massive burst of damage.

**\[Lvl 44] Surecast**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6X-QAI5bL3g_s2a3gWhW5zzNxITwPRHseKhsXxPedA_ksbOgJpTiIbgO_toIpoCkS7QG1nFgosvKyMybFW1qSjizJPLltyswgrXIkNLRob7fOKw75OoLDLevffoc9xJjYzfVKeV9)

Surecast is a spell that’s shared amongst all casters, and simply makes you immune to having your spells interrupted for six seconds as well as making you immune to mechanics that knock you back or draw you in. 

(Example: Leviathan)

**\[Lvl 45] Holy**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xA_gZ_vEJjyUTUN07neUEJO6Dk8i-L0IZ-2YRkLVPw1MiSdKOfjxmc6ouEcYmVz_y8cKIDmstYKl1JzO1UQJtbPaZQxqvf8ZpjtUAvrfZ_nfkwW4AyamxKrX0JMBBOzomq6ljv1e)

Once more, an amazing spell.

Holy alone changes White Mage completely. This is your first AoE skill that deals damage, but not only that, it stuns all enemies that were hit for four seconds. This can stack up to seven seconds.

So if done correctly this spell can single-handedly make your Tank immune to all damage for seven whole seconds, and the damage it does is nothing to scoff at either. Holy is an absolutely incredible spell for dungeon runs, and should be spammed during them whenever you have multiple enemies.

**\[Lvl 46] Aero II**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2bzem941XoEIlMvRHcPp_vsU3Fygx-tfX6HI-jOd05e8-gs9_AFigu7z8wzabmkgOGziv8jgBiNyLqD7tByGw6CRKd3YqbmSK8jpfQyqEyqgXU7lE2f0VYjFweSQPdSGszVkspNO)

Aero II acts as a direct upgrade to the original Aero spell.

**\[Lvl 48] Rescue**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YODnBhWgOMEHEh5z3WxaMKHea-pd2Ni9kDO3-ACx6_5C29n3ZPTXjIrEVYCyKsTtzN2KfCwmXEPrb1zcfS3ZJ6Pcr5evIhgr9MAF9z4ORkx9uMvxFb5Tn9YM8KpITLsU60JcPq-q)

Rescue is… Dangerous.

Rescue is a role action shared by all healers and it drags your targeted party member to you. Be careful when using this or risk drawing the ire of your party.

Really, just use it when someone is standing inside an AoE when it is obvious they cannot make it out of danger in time.

**\[Lvl 50] Benediction**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YB5nbK0XCp9LAkI-Nx8jIqGmWb2MJppwwA3hyw29GHNGfWK0P2TJtJebh4KNzo1dD07j72-2EH3nPm8PR1E63LH3dzKh7tyD4m-K13Dk8PL9zYZsDify2agLXIepQsdCWxhOkq7E)

Benediction is the granddaddy of all “oh crap” buttons, doing one thing and one thing only: healing 100% of your target’s HP. Simple as that. \
\
Use this spell if you’ve been lacking in heals and haven’t been paying attention to your (or your Tank’s) health, or find yourself dealing with massive damage on a single target.

**\[Lvl 50] Medica II**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/taYN6UZMTLrOk3-jBHSvE7tbB-TSpDztpPGsedXxFzfMap-FiFThjIKEpQUdc3VDCSNoo9ibofKg1Yb54Yn0-aIyq9sdqg98zAHj_WgyERcsfyNnDk1kCzrnBuHxvIDlb0mr1Iny)

Medica II is not an “upgraded” version of the original Medica, but should be treated as such.

Medica II is the same as Medica, but swaps out the instant healing for a regen effect. This CAN stack with your standard “Regen.”

In most cases, Medica II will be better than Medica, and in those cases where it is not… Cure III can be used instead.

## Rotation and Leveling (30 - 50)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/axV6qCu1M4cVkXMOKx6zRtAPW61anzeH-MAHGkMc6IVHWgZpwLWcA1cB3d9S3dCLsOjQwY-fniAzIEQpir6_KikxdlEebvFL132kIb3Nwxe3IHtgZUQLIS3rwVLvvGiifiRHYN3I)

White Mage at this level can be explained as a “regen and forget” healer. The regen capabilities are *so* powerful at this level that you can be carried by them. Try not to use them as a clutch, however, as this will change upon hitting higher levels.

If you’re above level 45, when pulling large mob packs, *spam the ever living life* out of Holy, as it will stun the group for seven seconds, allowing for a pseudo-seven second immunity for your Tank.

Otherwise, it’s safe to just throw a Regen on your Tank, and occasionally cast Cure II should the need arise. In any other case, cast Stone II while making sure you have uptime with Aero/Aero II.

As for tips with leveling, make sure to do your leveling roulette every day, and spam those dungeons.

# Level 50 to 70

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GxNKbDnpiIEAZtGcIRHR1UD57Vfh-gwmq0ErpNea7cYSvUnekFIYn4qeefZVQvyx_XVZNxMQseDzunpFnOQxpWmmPIv6m1MNQIj8oFQoB706vW_Qn6YLcbxo4l7kozR61CepwODy)

Upon reaching level 50, you now have access to your tomestone gear (assuming you’ve completed ‘A Realm Reborn’ and have the sufficient tomestones for trading!) and can access the vast majority of your roulettes.

On top of this, WHM also learns skills that make their life even easier upon reaching the higher levels, such as access to their **Lilies**, more burst healing options, *even more* regen and a way to conserve MP.

## Skills and Spells (50 - 70)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PAFIl5KSACckujeK8pDD9ZLvU2ICu8hf08yAZ3fBQLsOWxSwbLOr-5B1Ofpqpao10SZHg3KH6TyKvx9xsFCleqvjMXqvHfUiYbKv4MG6k3PnF8SAtochGRavdaRORbybZsftHBDT)

**\[Lvl 52] Afflatus Solace**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cj7k9xNc790M5jGDdnzRQw5usHT7xYNh-yPseuYuUqoNTsdgfs6fZk-avEMV9hCCsnPFPKPoh5mbb45KbfTcZhbr9Lp8XmzcZp8AZ6AKaCH_RppvU12dNrkAliL5a9Ay1-Rhlr_A)

Congratulations, you just earned your first Lily spell. Afflatus Solace adds a new gauge to your screen which fills up one Lily every 30 seconds, and you can use said Lilies on spells beginning with “Afflatus.” These spells are instant cast, which allow you to have easier access to instant heals, rather than a delay as you wait for Cure II to finish casting.

(Ignore the “Nourishes the Blood Lily” part, that will come later).

**\[Lvl 52] Asylum**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/58uzwHpAwmC2Sn31npyuj5bWaJMegqZ1635p2Y3xSqhfFWeaupVVgAP84lktlgznVQp5zyB2ZYaA8mdov2yD2LF1CucUswfQRbhOGIXPeUcdjyLK3ASWWtY49bRCWcxklM_1RMOJ)

In a rare moment, you actually learn two spells at level 52, the second being Asylum, which is a ground-targeted AoE Regen. It places a big dome which gives a regen to anyone within its radius.

**\[Lvl 54] Stone III**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/msFXtCguWuoqqIwGkV6xe66eue1IeL-51D3IesOcbzG7b6xmk5f4EC8i0tH538OaWB8eDS_0LJ64NxAlnlng1znVS7UOOBAE7ouyIxiKdOTvEaIgj1qpvh9WUu6hWB_sh12pehu-)

Stone III is another Stone upgrade.

**\[Lvl 56] Assize**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L4R-f_B02bI2OdtMf1Asq26ro5jA2C1vRZ8ixGBnOkvgtcR_FgryI6qs-kRI9yt9QmywUyHv-aQRcs6bH0Mi7hRjbIpir_Af8klwHVJHoYvy1nBroDrmJWpbirqBQ8i83jYaChnU)

Assize is another oGCD that does double duty, in the sense that it both heals any party members nearby and deals damage to any enemies nearby as well.

Not only that, but it also restores 500 MP on use.

This spell deals very respectable damage and heals a very respectable amount, making it a spell to use on cooldown consistently even if you don’t heal or deal damage. The MP restoration is very good on its own too.

**\[Lvl 58] Thin Air**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dr8DBIc1JWs6bUiRHhnMMQiCTmQS_YGfbZTiMTZ8T9oi2jbc6mZol_-cDr5Oeytg1_YDeiFM1Vaz6QM2C84Z7ze22lip664jIZaWFIyFf8mAuUsIvnFk-QApk811zpNAUjXVjeVq)

Thin Air is a buff given to yourself which lasts for 12 seconds and makes every spell you cast completely free. 

This can be used during Holy spam, to go light on your MP, or when spamming a high cost heal, such as Cure III.

**\[Lvl 60] Tetragrammaton**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/f8v1tKc5zzPJkwhw-9NbGH0I-1YQRh5v9282TiPloiA0jK4LZAi6aKodwJhhC6W-njGQuI2GMaBWk6xw1EepxLgAdT4EJxE0hb414fnx46z8NB4uTfd-W1Eg1uS2s32bPNHkGFFR)

Tetragrammaton can be translated as “four letter word,” which is precisely the amount of letters in the word that you will say when this spell is handy.

Tetragrammaton is used for when you need to emergency heal someone but you have no Lilies, no Benediction and a Cure II would take too long to cast.

**\[Lvl 64] Stone IV**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8BFPjE4mupblubU_VA550bO8fEWrNfvIvtLDpoj1pt-A16UeT1EuMLohG4w3VwQXMfoZRimUMW5GEU9qc63Cgy73OfyXg15yoL1dxLnkCNPTlPwVYyaJAb1qCnjBjEbkRSK6vprC)

Stone IV is another Stone upgrade!

**\[Lvl 66] Divine Benison**

Divine Benison is a spell that breaks the rules of WHM, allowing WHM to for a brief moment become a shield healer.

This spell is typically thrown on the tank to help mitigate tank busters or as just a general “on cooldown” spell to keep your own sanity as the damage it mitigates is sizable.

**\[Lvl 70] Plenary Indulgence**

Plenary Indulgence is a spell that is strangely worded. 

What this spell does is that when cast, all party members within a 20 yalm radius receive a buff called “Confession.” This buff will then heal them for a potency of 200 upon casting any of your AoE heals, which includes Medica, Medica II, Cure III, or Afflatus Rapture (later in the guide).

This spell is essentially a doubler for your AoE heals, which allows them to heal for just that bit more, sometimes needed for massive raidwide attacks.

## Rotation and Leveling (50 - 70)

With the addition of Afflatus Solace to your toolkit, White Mage becomes an even more lenient job in terms of healing. **Lilies** build up over time and you can use them whenever you have one up in place of a GCD heal to keep your damage uptime and keep people healed. 

**Assize** allows you even more burst options in terms of your damage and healing, as well as serving as another way to regain MP should Lucid Dreaming be unavailable.

**Asylum** acts as another piece to your “Regen and forget” repertoire, as the regen provided by the dome is surprisingly strong and is on a relatively short cooldown.

**Thin Air** is another spell to help you preserve MP, allowing you to not run out as much when you are lost in the sauce of spamming Holy for AoE.

**Tetragrammaton** allows you to have burst healing in cases where you need healing as soon as possible..

**Divine Benison** lets you focus on doing damage even more than you already were before. Throw this on before a trash pack pull, then start spamming your Holy can as the shield from Divine Benison can prevent most of the healing you’d need to do otherwise.

**Plenary Indulgence** is there for when raid-wide damage happens, allowing you to better heal everyone should the occasion call for it.

At this level, and frankly for all levels, your rotation rarely changes outside of Stone spam, keeping Aero up, and casting certain spells on cooldown, including: 

* Every 45 seconds, cast Assize.
* Every 30 seconds, cast Divine Benison (or wait until a Tank buster as long as you don’t lose a use of the spell).
* Every 15 - 18 seconds, reapply Aero II.
* Otherwise cast Stone III/Stone IV.

As for leveling, at this level range you have access to all your roulettes, which essentially means to make sure you do them all every day. 

Make sure to at least do Main Scenario & Frontline every day for *massive* EXP.

Your other sources of EXP can come from Wondrous Tales, Challenge Log, Hunting Log, Palace of the Dead/Heaven on High and dungeons.

# Level 70 - 80

These 10 levels are the final stretch until you reach the level cap of Shadowbringers. In this range, you will gain access to more Lily spells, including the bloodiest of them all - Afflatus Misery - and yet another healing accelerator at Level 80. Asylum will see improvements as well.

## Skills and Spells (70 - 80)

**\[Lvl 72] Dia**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xmYvXkg9izPpEq63APBkSavZfU09P48LeFFLZV249vBHEm3wnNNilqhRM1amrS-ptOBk5MSro9mls9wtiZ7mRv2TrZxZpYpeP7ULgdx6yxb6sHdzEl1u4aQEQbW8gGznaH-Cp9p)

An upgrade to Aero II with two notable differences.

Firstly Dia deals unaspected damage, so in the rare case that an enemy would resist wind, Dia bypasses that resistence. The second change is that this DoT lasts for 30 seconds instead of 18.

**\[Lvl 72] Glare**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nhm-fe2ID9abyTcx-VzsoZtZSE2xSVSU0q9sKIdV3fJHtIen2iqUX27VvycgADifXUNdgEbLR0suF2CUlola4bLj9lKSeZdlzX8URV1cZmMamAhA-q1hBp-_nWbVShJalf2zvQB8)

Your ascension is complete: you can now become a Glare Mage.\
Glare is another upgrade to Stone.

**\[Lvl 74] Afflatus Misery**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/igWCqeN58w4zKYJvaQjMLOyxlR6mjwWCVb2L43t-kURDu7BAyAgzc_WkQH7dZxBzk7WNqZ6UKTp9V81jyywpqdWRxVdt6L4dNJnvVuLZjb4Tr7x4m_7D2-zZaUtHM6LLe0UKLyUt)

**“Blood for the Blood Lily!”**\
Upon casting 3 spells that consume your Lily gauge, the Blood Lily will bloom, allowing the use of Afflatus Misery which deals **massive** damage to all enemies in the area around the target.

However, despite the absolutely *bonkers* potency on the damage, it may not always be worth it to waste your Lily spells to get to this spell faster (at least for single target). Acquiring a Blood Lily takes four GCDs from zero (not accounting for the 90 seconds required for 3 Lilies to bloom in the first place) and Glare deals damage with 300 potency, which when casted three times, equals the potency of Afflatus Misery.

**\[Lvl 76] Afflatus Rapture**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fDQ7qHQN81mQMuTGZWl6YKRN-qxzfrBGFQbbm7nlhyqtLWbbBFUvk9FICNEx6rMasCCtTHgE4niw71svnQFVOaYYt6wfQjuLg4YyVT9BpqW-N2DKkXGYbQ9zDvuDtX3dpjtXa4Ec)

Afflatus Rapture is essentially an AoE version of Afflatus Solace, healing for the same amount as Medica but as an instant cast. It also nourishes your Blood Lily.

**\[Lvl 78] Enhanced Asylum**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8nEQkjN3xBIRAYPACbpdpuwlEDjJMJzNjkxyPXyNq26JFv9tBNPX1tmku5QoAbplHdNwO-m8yK86eQIJBGyxUEIb5a4Wp8ehJxs2r4JELDXGh8eGLVoH0GIK-HZrjvIG_7ZKQgUU)

At this level, Asylum gets buffed to increase healing by 10% when players are standing within it, allowing for easier healing when Asylum is up.

**\[Lvl 80] Temperance**

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TvpoeU1Y_4F3hnh-V6lLTQ1vNrU7C-1gidaPOy9ulS0F_60fuvoEK9laMpfSF8plh6-Ud1BceqLruA1ANzCIly4ZWBVeN_0-dwEfTtc5Txshx5rXv49drpAUNNSuY3JcSFYQ-Q4B)

And, finally; the last skill you learn as of patch 5.58, Temperance.\
\
This spell acts as your steroids, buffing healing magic potency by 20% and reducing all damage taken by nearby party members within 30 yalms by 10% for 20 seconds. \
\
It also gives you very pretty wings.

## Rotation and Leveling (70 - 80)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dY9z0S8i4B_wUx2UO5yLfPKjIdWPE5bUQ4FZNSiIeVNyF7nVIu4DXiqw8SDy29DpYOy63XgXk9l2OTGWC1ppIuL33Z7kJdi9YiuatndzNXMm5_0ELW6gxQd49IVfzvZPuUK9pIWu)

Finally within the home stretch. 

If you’ve unlocked The Bozjan Southern Front, it is one of the best (if not the best) ways to level from 71 - 80. That said, it can also get extremely grating and boring after a while. It is recommended to keep doing your dailies, weeklies, etc., which should give you enough EXP to break up the monotony.

Your rotation for WHM at level 72+ is very, very simple;

* Keep Dia up, and cast Glare.

That’s it, *really.*

You should keep track of your cooldowns, including Presence of Mind, Asylum, Assize, Thin Air, Plenary Indulgence and Temperance.\
Usually you want to cast these on cooldown, or whenever the situation calls for it, as outlined before.

# Level 80

And with all that, you’re at level 80! **Congratulations!**
