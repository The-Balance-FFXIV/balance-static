# Introduction

This document contains suggestions on how to use your cooldowns effectively and small things you can do to play each phase as effectively as possible. Ideally, you should communicate with your co-Healer to make a plan that reduces stress for both of you and maximizes damage between you while being safe.


# The Omega Protocol (TOP)


## Gearing

TOP requires less mana than DSR so you can just use this [2.40 set](https://etro.gg/gearset/a91cf8ba-5ea1-4050-82c0-b90862a77ac0). The benefits of 2.40 can come from good Chain/Aetherflow alignment and the ability to cast more broils during Pantokrator. That being said once you’re more comfortable with the first phase you will need to start holding at the end so as not to kill Omega too fast so the more broils will become more and more worthless. 


## Phase By Phase Fight Tips


### Phase One: Omega



* Program Loop
* Excogitation can be put on a Third-in-Line or Fourth-in-Line player as soon as debuffs go out, it will pop after their max hp debuff falls off
* Using swift for movement early will let it come back up in Panto
* Pantokrator
* As mentioned in 


[Gearing](), 2.40 lets you slide cast more of this mechanic but not all of it, realize when you’re losing pace and use a Ruin II. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part of the trick here is to move up two puddles worth during the free movement of Ruin II so that you have an easy time on the next slidecast, but don't grief with the puddle.</span>**
* Wave Cannon Kyrios
* Use Recitation Deploy and Expedient before moving out, use Seraph for healing during the mechanic. If you have enough mit you won’t need to Consolation until after the second set of missiles/stacks. 
* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">It’s better for your group to use aoe mit at the start of Pantokrator and use targeted mits for the later missile/laser waves. </span>**
* While progging I highly suggest you hold if you’re going to kill too fast. Bringing DPS into p2 will make it much easier to beat the check if you’re way ahead of the check in Omega.


### Phase Two: Omega-M/F



* Firewall
* Dot does not work on anyone you’re firewalled against so do not double dot.
* It’s best to have 3 strong dps on one boss with your highest dealing tank and the rest on the other boss. This lets you put Chain and other targeted raid buffs on the boss with 3 dps maximizing its value vs 2 dps
* Art of War is a 65 potency gain over Broil IV and Bio is 70 damage per tick so it’s better to Bio first in the opener.
* Soil is excellent for double tank busters giving 10% mitigation on both tanks with powerful regen on both
* It’s free to end this first uptime phase with a Swiftcast Broil to guarantee it doesn’t ghost
* Party Synergy
* Just Succor before each hit during this downtime mechanic
* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dissipation will come back around the knockback if you dissipation first opener if you use this make sure to drain your Aetherflow gauge since Aetherflow ability will be almost off cd. </span>**
* Limitless Synergy
* Scholars have an easy time with stacking flares as they can use Spreadlo during Limitless Synergy and Hello world first tower. Use your first Spreadlo halfway through the limitless synergy cast, it’ll last long enough and come back for Hello World's first tower.
* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stacking flares is easy for scholars as long as your group uses all non-targeted mitigation. Seraph can also be used after tank buster covering meteor and the aoe afterward. Doing so will make Seraph come back up for the second set of towers in Hello, World.</span>**
* Soil can be used once flare markers show up and will last through Cosmo Memory


### Phase Three: Omega Reconfigured



* Intermission
* Make sure to use a Succor after Omega-F dies before people spread out
* Another Succor can be cast at the end of the transition before Final Omega becomes targetable
* Hello, World
* You’ll want enough shields and mitigation on each set that you don’t need to heal during sets
* You should be going center for every set so you can Succor the party
* Recitation Deploy can be used for the first set and will be ready to use for p4
* Seraph can be used to cover sets 2 and 3 and will come back at the start of p4
* Abuse other remote healing/mitigation options such as Fey Illumination, Whispering Dawn, and Fey Blessing while the party is spread out
* Monitors
* Requires no mitigation, only does about 50k damage. Just make sure the party has enough hp
* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">You can use Art of War if your monitor resolves at an awkward time to keep your GCD rolling </span>**


### Phase Four: Blue Screen



* Wave Cannon
* Recitation Deploy can be used in the downtime between p3 and p4, will be back for p5
* Use Summon Seraph early on in this phase so that it comes back in the second half of RDD
* Soil used near the end of the Wave Cannon castbar will cover stacks 1 and 2 and be back for Blue Screen
* Blue Screen
* Succor and Sacred Soil, ensure party is full hp


### Phase Five: Run: Dynamis



* Run: Dynamis(Delta)
* Use shields when Omega-M and Omega-F disappear during the transition, they’ll last through the RDD hit
* Highly recommend Recitation Deploy is used **after** the RDD hit to help make healing easier during the actual mechanics
* Whispering Dawn used when the Code Smell debuffs expire/first Blue Tether breaks can easily hit everyone if they stand close to the Eye laser and ensures everyone is healthy for Monitors/Pile Pitch
* Fey Blessing and Consolations provide position agnostic healing after Monitors, very helpful for when healers have movement restricted due to their mechanics
* Use Succors during this mechanic when you’re standing still and there are unshielded party members, it’s free
* Excog can be used on a squishy party member during this mechanic for safety, same with tank CDs
* Run: Dynamis(Sigma)
* Succor between each hit of this mechanic
* Whispering Dawn is easy to get on everyone while waiting to be knocked back
* Fey Blessing is useful to hit everyone after towers
* If mitigating Solars 3 and 4, I recommend placing Soil center as HWs go off if it’s not needed for the RDO hit
* Run: Dynamis(Omega)
* If mitigating this Solar Ray you can Reci Deploy off the tank taking the second hit, shielding the party for RDO and keeping the tank keeping autos healthy
* Excogitation, Whispering Dawn, Fey Union, and Sacred Soil are all useful for keeping the tank taking autos healthy during the clone dodges
* Try to Succor for each Hello World hit, but it shouldn’t be vital
* Fey Blessing and Consolation again provide easy to use healing between Hello World sets
* Preplace Soil to mit busters at the end of the mechanic, feel free to Adlo a tank at the end of the mechanic too
* Tanks that take the Blaster tethers will require healing since they’re set to 1% HP
* Make sure to Succor for Blind Faith


### Phase Six: Alpha Omega



* General Soil tip
* You can use macros for soil to help with brain space. It’s strongly recommended to use a target soil macro for Cosmo Meteors to get it directly middle allowing everyone to be inside of it. 
* Do not use a target soil macro for Cosmo dive as your party can be clipped by the buster trying to stand inside the soil. You can manually place it like this image to make sure party and tanks are in it or you can place it on the party and trust your tanks to properly mit.
* You can use a target macro for wc1 and a me macro for the rest of the mechanics if you want to use less brain space. 
* Cosmo Memory
* Doesn’t need much mit to be survivable, I’d only use Soil here to help with the healing
* Cosmo Dive 1
* Preshield can be done when the second autoattack occurs after Cosmo Memory
* Seraph can be used to cover both this and the first hits of Wave Cannon 1, and will then be back for Cosmo Meteor. The easiest way to time this is to Summon Seraph when Cosmo Dive begins casting and use the first charge immediately. Use the second charge when the second autoattack after Dive occurs
* Dissipating just after Seraph ends will buff your shields for Wave Cannon 1 and fairy will return just after the Wave Cannon 1 stack
* Wave Cannon 1
* Preshield can be done when the second autoattack occurs after Cosmo Dive 1
* This is a good spot to use Recitation Deploy as it will be back for Cosmo Meteor. I recommend just using it before moving out to dodge exaflares, as it can be tight to get Deploy out on everyone after proteans, but if you need it to survive the stack it can be done
* Abuse Ruin 2 as needed to move for exaflares
* Sacred Soil placed middle after exaflares should let everyone stand inside it safely for both proteans and the stack
* Wave Cannon 2
* Preshield can be done when the second autoattack occurs after Wave Cannon 1
* I recommend using Expedient here as it’s often the place that’s short on mitigation. Expedient can cover both the proteans and stack if weaved after your Succor after the second auto, but be careful counting on it for stack mitigation since the timing is tight.
* Fey Illumination can cover both the proteans and stack easily thanks to being remote, just ensure people are in range when you use it
* Fey Blessing can be used right after proteans before people move in to range
* It’s not reliable to get people in Soil for the proteans due to Arrow movement, I recommend just using it when the party collapses for stack to ensure everyone gets the mit
* Cosmo Dive 2
* Preshield can be done when the second autoattack occurs after Wave Cannon 2
* Again abuse Ruin 2 for exaflare movement as needed
* Cosmo Meteor
* Preshield the party while stacked mid for the Cosmo Meteor baits
* Recitation Deploy is highly recommended here. You can let your cohealer take mid during meteors and Reci Deploy off them between the first and second sets to maximize healing/shielding. **Make sure the party does not move too far out, or Deploy may miss some people. **If not necessary you can just Deploy while stacked mid for baits
* Summon Seraph is also highly recommended here, use Consolation after the first set of meteor spreads, and then after the second set of meteor spreads to maximize effectiveness. Summon Seraph itself can be used while moving out to your spot after doing the mid baits
* Swift Succor and Indom can both be done between second meteor spreads and flare/stack for safety
* Magic Numbers
* The party only needs to be full hp for these, and they should always be full hp for the second one due to Healer LB3. Use any oGCDs you have available to help heal the party before the first one, and consider using Sacred Soil for safety.
