      * DO NOT USE IN UNOPTIMZED ENVIRONMENTS

      * This set has slightly lower average damage than the SpS BiS but higher variance due to a higher amount of Crit and DH. This may be of value to you if you're a parser or speedrunner looking exclusively for high roll runs.

      * DO NOT USE IN UNOPTIMIZED ENVIORNMENT

      * This set has the highest average damage of the two BiS sets and is the more consistent one. It has very dangerous MP economy due to the fast GCD and min Piety.

# SCH BiS and Gear Options

# 5.55 Savage Sets

***So, why the hell is SCH BiS 2.32 GCD this tier?***  \
The short answer is that our gear absolutely sucks for 2.41 this tier. We either have to take on a bunch of piety or use crafted gear, and neither one is efficient. 2.32 GCD lines up AF well, but sits on a sort of halfway point of DoT timings that requires us to alternate between 12 GCD and 13 GCD Bios, which can result in lost Bio ticks. This still makes it the most efficient GCD that we're able to hit at the moment damage wise, that doesn't throw off AF alignment or give us meme levels of mana efficiency.

*Note: I can't make sets for every permutation of what relic stuff you're willing to grind, so there will only be sets that assume you have no relic stuff or all the relic stuff. The relic sets do more damage than their respective non-relic equivalents.*

# NON-RELIC SETS

## Non-Relic High Piety

* Safe to run in any environment.  
* Perfect for those with no interest in optimizing or a fear of PF.  
* Still has decent GCD alignment, but will drift over time.
* 2.39 GCD  

https://etro.gg/gearset/4f21e0e3-d02e-4c58-a11d-a5cb062efcf8

## Non-Relic Mid Piety

* This set picks up some extra piety while still maintaining a 2.32 GCD for good AF alignment.
* Very comfortable amount of  Piety in my opinion, but still requires solid fundamental MP-management skills on later floors.
* 2.32 GCD

<https://etro.gg/gearset/1652ae0d-deea-4d86-9b4e-f5959f5232d4>

## Non-Relic Low Piety

* The best set for this tier without using Relic gear. Mana is tight on E12S Phase 1.
* ONLY USE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AS USUAL. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU RUN OUT OF MANA.
* 2.33 GCD

<https://etro.gg/gearset/198b6d3f-899e-4103-ae06-329c116ecd67>

# RELIC SETS

## 5.55 High Piety

* Safe to run in any environment.
* Perfect for those with no interest in optimizing or a fear of PF. The long awaited return of 2.41.
* 2.41 GCD

<https://etro.gg/gearset/3b894bb4-3dd6-4fcd-adfd-0d4d43c37fea>

## 5.55 Mid Piety

* Very good mana economy while maintaining 2.41 GCD for the best AF alignment.
* The best High Ping Friendly Set as well.
* 2.41 GCD

<https://etro.gg/gearset/7c0aefb5-c149-4eb4-9876-b9ef244e13a8>

## 5.55 Lo Piety

* A better version of the best Non-Relic Set you can make. Mana is tight on E12S Phase 1.
* ONLY USE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AS USUAL. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU RUN OUT OF MANA.
* 2.32 GCD

<https://etro.gg/gearset/fd9ea1b9-8390-4ccc-9d36-36476fd6bfc8>

## 5.55 Min Piety Sets

* These sets use the Bozja pants to drop us down to min piety, giving a decent DPS gain at the cost of very low MP regeneration.
* Playing the longer or more healing intensive fights with this set requires very good planning.
* Don't use them on E12S Phase 1 especially unless you're fully confident in your ability to do so.
* ONLY USE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AS USUAL. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU RUN OUT OF MANA.

# ULTIMATE SETS

## A Note on the 515 and 535 Relic Books

Due to their totally customizable and adjustable stats, the Augmented Law's Order Codex and Blade's Wisdom are the ideal choice for all 3 previous ultimate fights (Blade's Wisdom provides 15 more substats in UWU and TEA, in UCOB they're functionally identical).

You can redistribute stats to ensure none are wasted on the fight by treating the cap on each substat as the cap at that ilvl.

For each fight those caps are:

TEA: 467  
UWU: 318  
UCOB: 280  

## TEA Prog Set

Flexible set able to accommodate a wide range of Piety levels and 2 different GCDs.  Standard setup uses Smoked Chicken for 2.42, you can use Twilight Popoto Salad for 2.41 or Golden Pineapple Juice for some extra Piety. You can put Piety instead of Det on Relic if desired (in any amount you want) and the Piety melds can be stripped out for Det/DH if you feel you wanna go lower (Existing Det melds can be swapped to DH too).

TL;DR: Use this as a starting point and adjust to comfort.

**2.42/2.41 GCD:**

<https://etro.gg/gearset/43bd7245-0e65-4bf6-8f23-5cfdefc62b95>\

*Yes*, the chest is unmelded, it's getting synced so what melds are in it (or even whether there are melds in it) is irrelevant.

*Yes*, it's still the best option, the 520 Nier chest and 520 Augmented Exarchic chest are both slightly worse alternatives, as is a Crit melded 470 Augmented Deepshadow Chest.

## Other TEA Sets

Check the SCH Gear Calc and navigate to the TEA tab for old sets without the Relic/Dungeon gear.

## 5.5 Ultimate Prog Set

UCOB and UWU gear sets can be synced down with little to no loss. I recommend using a standard GCD (\~2.42) and taking \~800-1000 Piety for prog.
