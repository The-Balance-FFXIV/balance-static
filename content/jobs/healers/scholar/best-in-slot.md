      * This set has slightly lower average damage than the SpS BiS but higher
      variance due to a higher amount of DH. This may be of value to you if
      you're a parser or speedrunner looking exclusively for high roll runs.

      * Gives good Chain alignment and poor Bio alignment

      * 2.40 GCD

      * This set has the highest average damage of the two BiS sets and is the
      more consistent one. It has very dangerous MP economy due to the fast GCD
      and min Piety.

      * Gives good Chain and Bio alignment

      * 2.31 GCD

      **The piety requirements vary depending on your p7 strat for akh morns.
      332 requires more GCD healing while 611 is laxer.**


      * A very good amount of piety for prog and a slow GCD to help conserve mp.

      * Suggested if you're currently progging the fight

      * If you use this set with 332 or you're unsure how to properly manage your mana you will oom. 

      * Suggested if you want to optimize after clearing
