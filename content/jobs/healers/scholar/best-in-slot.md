      ## **2.5GCD and 2.49 GCD info:**


      In the game, your global cooldown (GCD) timing is determined by when the game code aligns with your frame updates. This happens once per frame. If your next action doesn't sync perfectly with these frames, there can be slight delays in your GCD. This is especially noticeable on lower FPS. Fluctuating frame rates can also make your GCD more unpredictable. Over the course of a battle, these delays could mean that a gear set with a supposed 2.5 GCD might actually function more like a 2.505 GCD. Players with higher FPS will suffer the effects of this issue less but will never be able to fully eliminate them.


      Third-party tools like ReAction help to mitigate this effect by syncing your frames with when your GCD is ready. To better understand how this works for your specific character, you can make comparisons using a GCD calculator. By inputting fflogs into the calculator, you can see the actual duration of your GCDs during gameplay. It's advisable to use multiple logs for accuracy and disregard any anomalous data. For a practical tool to calculate GCDs, you can visit https://gcdcalc.fly.dev/



      ## **Dot Refresh:**


      If using the Early Refresh(DoT clip) opener: The 2.50 GCD and 2.49 GCD sets will NOT land Biolysis under Chain Stratagem if you use Biolysis AFTER your 6th Energy Drain in the opener (the breakpoint is 2.47 GCD and requires low ping). To fix this, use Biolysis on the same GCD as your 6th Energy Drain.

      # __Week 1 BiS__

      With a long Savage delay, this tier presents options to buy tome gear which are part of week 1 BiS but not final BiS.

      Please read below for considerations on how to spend your tomes for week 1 prog.


      **Option A** - Tome Chest + Wrist + Ring:

      - On track to final BiS. No tomes "wasted"

      - Lower damage but naturally has higher Piety which has value in prog


      **Option B** - Tome Chest + Wrist + Earrings:

      - Diverts 375 tomes to earrings which are not part of SCH's final BiS

      - Higher damage (~0.3-0.9% depending on choice of Piety and GCD speed)


      7.4 Week 1 BiS: <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl|431e6073-3723-4da9-8078-25c0fcf679a5>

      If you're not capping tomes week 1 (all these sets use Tome Earrings): <https://xivgear.app/?page=sl|a7cdf253-a7eb-42dd-8fb6-90cf5412b46e>



      # __Savage BiS__


      This tier we're back to using double tome rings to dodge Piety, this naturally reduces our defensive stats since our gear is lower ilvl. It most likely won't matter in the grand scheme of things, outside of a very small niche scenario. That being said Max ilvl sets will be the safest to take into the upcoming Ultimate and can be used for those who want to maximize survivability outside of that as well.


      We don't have 2.50 sets this tier because of piety reasons. The 2.31 sets sim higher than the 2.40 set however, it loses a lot more dhit and crit opening up 2.40 sets to have a higher chance to have luckier runs.


      ## **Tome buy order:**

      Chest > Wrist > Ring > Ring

      FRU sets are based on gear available, this includes FRU weapon and Chaotic
      Alliance raid gear. Outside of that sets are separated by speed, i
      personally suggest just picking whatever you enjoy or the highest sim dps.
