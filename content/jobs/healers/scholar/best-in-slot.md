    description: This set has slightly lower average damage than the SpS BiS but is
      less ping sensitive and has better MP economy due to a slower GCD. If you
      want to parse this set can reach those god runs a little easier. 2.40
      gives perfect Chain alignment, but poor Bio alignment.

    description: This set has the highest average damage of the BiS sets and is the
      more consistent one. It has very dangerous MP economy due to the fast GCD
      and min Piety. 2.31 gives it good Chain and Bio alignment.
