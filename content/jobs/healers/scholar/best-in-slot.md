          * Safe to run in any environment.
          * Perfect for those with no interest in optimizing or a fear of PF.
          * Gives a good Chain alignment, but a poor Bio alignment
          * 2.40 GCD

      * This set has slightly lower average damage than the SpS BiS but higher
      variance due to a higher amount of DH. This may be of value to you if
      you're a parser or speedrunner looking exclusively for high roll runs.

      * Gives good Chain alignment and poor Bio alignment

      * 2.40 GCD

      * This set has the highest average damage of the two BiS sets and is the
      more consistent one. It has very dangerous MP economy due to the fast GCD
      and min Piety.

      * Gives good Chain and Bio alignment

      * 2.31 GCD

      * safe to run
      * The next set has extra pieces for more piety if needed
      * Terrible alignment but in ultimates, but that matters a little less.
      * 2.47

      * This Set makes it much smoother to slidecast during Pantokrator

      * Still has a good amount of piety

      * If you want to drop some piety you can swap earring or gloves, but be very careful doing so as later phaes could have harsher MP requirements.

      **The piety requirements vary depending on your P7 strat for Akh Morns.
      332 requires more GCD healing while 611 is laxer.**


      * A very good amount of piety for prog and a slow GCD to help conserve mana.

      * Suggested if you're currently progging the fight

      332 requires more GCD healing while 611 is laxer.**


      * If you use this set with 332 or if you're unsure how to properly manage your mana you will run out of mana. 

      * Suggested if you want to optimize after clearing
