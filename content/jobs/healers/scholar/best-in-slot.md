      # information


      ## **2.5GCD and 2.49 GCD info:**


      In the game, your global cooldown (GCD) timing is determined by when the game code aligns with your frame updates. This happens once per frame. If your next action doesn't sync perfectly with these frames, there can be slight delays in your GCD. This is especially noticeable on lower FPS. Fluctuating frame rates can also make your GCD more unpredictable. Over the course of a battle, these delays could mean that a gear set with a supposed 2.5 GCD might actually function more like a 2.505 GCD. Players with higher FPS will suffer the effects of this issue less but will never be able to fully eliminate them.


      Third-party tools like ReAction help to mitigate this effect by syncing your frames with when your GCD is ready. To better understand how this works for your specific character, you can make comparisons using a GCD calculator. By inputting fflogs into the calculator, you can see the actual duration of your GCDs during gameplay. It's advisable to use multiple logs for accuracy and disregard any anomalous data. For a practical tool to calculate GCDs, you can visit https://gcdcalc.fly.dev/\



      ## **Dot Refresh:**


      If using the Early Refresh(DoT clip) opener: The 2.50 GCD and 2.49 GCD sets will NOT land Biolysis under Chain Stratagem if you use Biolysis AFTER your 6th Energy Drain in the opener (the breakpoint is 2.47 GCD and requires low ping). To fix this, use Biolysis on the same GCD as your 6th Energy Drain.

    description: "* This is the generally recommended set. It has great alignment
      for both Aetherflow and Chain Stratagem, and its slower GCD ensures that
      you will have more MP for raises and GCD healing."

    name: 2.32 GCD
    description: >-
      This set provides the highest simulated DPS. Despite its simulated DPS,
      its awkward GCD alignment for Chain Stratagem and its increased MP
      expenditure prevent it from being the default recommendation. It may not
      be as easy or comfortable to use as the 2.40 set, but its higher simulated
      DPS makes it a reasonable consideration.


      This set has relatively good alignment for Aetherflow, but this GCD causes Chain Stratagem to drift by 0.6-0.7s per use. That amount of drift may or may not matter.


      If your group's burst is not well timed, the slight Chain Stratagem drift is probably irrelevant. Even if your group's burst is coordinated, raid buffs tend to drift a little over the course of an encounter, so the slight Chain Stratagem drift might not actually cause it to be misaligned.


      If the encounter is short enough (less than 8 or 10 minutes), or if your group ever delays raid buffs because of mechanics or downtime, the slight Chain Stratagem drift should not be significant.

    name: 2.31 GCD
    description: >-
      This is a suitable alternative for players who prefer a faster GCD without
      dealing with the slightly awkward GCD alignment of the 2.32 set. Its
      simulated DPS is slightly worse, but it may be more comfortable to use,
      depending on your personal preference.


      Even with the faster GCD, this set's MP should still be perfectly sustainable in a somewhat organized environment where you do not expect to cast multiple raises or do a lot of GCD healing.

    description: DSR The piety requirements vary depending on your p7 strat for akh
      morns. 332 requires more GCD healing while 611 is laxer. Choose a GCD
      based on the gear you're willing to farm. 2.5 provids mainly sync gear
      while 2.45/2.40 has p1s-p4s raid gear
