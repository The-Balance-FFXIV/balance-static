      # information


      ## **2.5GCD and 2.49 GCD info:**


      In the game, your global cooldown (GCD) timing is determined by when the game code aligns with your frame updates. This happens once per frame. If your next action doesn't sync perfectly with these frames, there can be slight delays in your GCD. This is especially noticeable on lower FPS. Fluctuating frame rates can also make your GCD more unpredictable. Over the course of a battle, these delays could mean that a gear set with a supposed 2.5 GCD might actually function more like a 2.505 GCD. Players with higher FPS will suffer the effects of this issue less but will never be able to fully eliminate them.


      Third-party tools like ReAction help to mitigate this effect by syncing your frames with when your GCD is ready. To better understand how this works for your specific character, you can make comparisons using a GCD calculator. By inputting fflogs into the calculator, you can see the actual duration of your GCDs during gameplay. It's advisable to use multiple logs for accuracy and disregard any anomalous data. For a practical tool to calculate GCDs, you can visit https://gcdcalc.fly.dev/\



      ## **Dot Refresh:**


      If using the Early Refresh(DoT clip) opener: The 2.50 GCD and 2.49 GCD sets will NOT land Biolysis under Chain Stratagem if you use Biolysis AFTER your 6th Energy Drain in the opener (the breakpoint is 2.47 GCD and requires low ping). To fix this, use Biolysis on the same GCD as your 6th Energy Drain.

      The i729 versions of the 2.5 and 2.49 sets are practical all-rounder sets.
      They are only behind their i727 counterparts by single-digit DPS and offer
      more HP, piety and magic defense in return.


      We recommend the 2.5/2.49 set for general use

      These sets are for people who value eHP or want to start working towards
      Futures Rewritten (Ultimate). FRU sets are between 2.50/2.49 low piety
      sets and a higher piety 2.5 set. Choose whichever one seems more in line
      with your goals.


      We recommend the 2.5/2.49 set or the  2.5 higher piety set.

      These sets are for people who are interested in speeds/parsing and want
      the most damage they can get. These sets use 710 items so your eHP will be
      lower. The 2.5 set may parse better with higher variance but 2.31 has more
      consistent damage.




      We recommend the 2.5 or 2.31 sets.
