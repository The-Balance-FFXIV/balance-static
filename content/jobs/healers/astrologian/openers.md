# Opener

The most up to date Astrologian opener(s) can always be found in the #ast_resources channel on The Balance Discord. Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are somewhat flexible, and can be adjusted based on the context of a fight, or any given burst window.

For clarity, **The Balance and The Spear are not being used on you. They are to demonstrate their timings relative to our own buffs. Please do not card yourself in raids** (Lightspeed can be used anywhere after that first combust to a late weave after the following Fall Malefic.

**Some notes:**

* \-2.1s prepull due to how long it takes for Malefic to apply to the boss. Enemies are pulled not when casts are finished, but when casts are **applied**. Malefic takes a LONG time to apply to the boss.
* Star is labeled as -4s because that has become our bread and butter, but it can be anywhere from -4s -> ~ -19s
* Yes, even with buffs being standardized to "2nd" GCD, we still want to use Div right after our 3rd currently.

Why? Because it is more accurate to say that we want Div out at \~5.5s (so it finished propagating by \~6). We have two options here: either \~4.6s, or \~5.8s. Currently overshooting by a couple tenths is more preferable for raid damage than early shooting by almost a full second. At faster GCDs, that early "3rd GCD" Div squeezes closer to ~5.6s.

In Dawntrail, all healers are recommended to early refresh their DoT in buffs.

(as long as any exist) Now that buffs are ~20s long, the math has dramatically swung in favor of the early refresh as a generic starting point. As always, adjust rotation for bosses as needed.
