    name: Week 1 Sets Information
    description: >-
      Your options for week 1 are listed below. I have separated out the
      important sets, all of which include 4 weeks of tomes.

      If you have fewer than 4 weeks of tomes, access the composite sheet link below.


      All sets buy the Tome chest. Most buy the tome bracelet, tome earring and normal mode pants. Some buy a ring instead of one of the other jewels. The Piety sets skip the normal mode pants.


      If you have special other needs not covered in these sets (less weeks of tomes, ornate chest purchased, a tome earring ate your favorite pet turtle once) then you can export the sheet, adjust the gear to your needs, and then have the internal sim solve melds for you.


      ####  **Note** - Tome Earring is better damage for week 1 purposes, but will NOT be a part of final BiS. If you are averse to wasting tomes and/or wish to have more MP, the Tome Ring sets are better. If you only have healers to gear on a character, I do recommend the Tome Earring sets, but ultimately it is your own decision.
