      Use these sets for GENERAL PURPOSE, such as PF and reclears. The super
      small damage loss is negligible in these situations, and the much higher
      survivability matters a lot more. Get your clears. 


      These will also be our sets for ultimate. Prep a set for yourself for the upcoming 7.1 FRU.

    description: >-
      Use these sets for SPEEDRUNNING, and OPTIMIZED ENVIRONMENTS. There is
      objectively a damage gain to using these, and will be the better choice
      generally for parse parties and speedrun environments. 


      Do NOT use these for ultimate. If I catch any one of you running i710 left side for FRU, I'm cursing you with 0% Oracle crit rate for the rest of eternity.
