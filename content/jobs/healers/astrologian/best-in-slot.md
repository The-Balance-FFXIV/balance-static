      This set is ideal for players who prefer a faster GCD. It is expected to
      provide very slightly less DPS than the 2.46 set, but the difference is
      negligible.


      This set will burn through MP considerably faster than the 2.46 set, so it may not be ideal if you expect to cast multiple raises or do a lot of GCD healing.

      This is the generally recommended set. It provides the highest expected
      DPS, and the relatively slow GCD ensures that you will have plenty of MP
      for raises and GCD healing. This set should also be identical to the
      highest DPS sets for both WHM and SGE.
