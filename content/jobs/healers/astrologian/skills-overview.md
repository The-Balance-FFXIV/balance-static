* If you are colorblind, melee cards have a + to the side of the card while ranged cards have a little o+ to the side of the card
* Playing cards while you and your target are both in combat will give you a seal in your arcana gauge
* Try not to over cap on draw charges
* Playing one card every 1 minute and 3 cards every 2 minutes is optimal in raid boss fights
* In dungeons use cards as you get them on trash
* The Draw ability gives you Clarifying Draw giving you the ability to use Redraw
* Redraw draws a different card from your deck replacing the card you had

       *Aoe damage in a 20y radius around you (250p)*

              Is drawn with Minor Arcana and needs Crown play ability to play it.
              *Use a weave window* 
              Use this as an additional heal if you have it. It should not be put in heal plans as you may not always get it.

![](/img/jobs/ast/divination.png)

**Divination 2m cd**

* Raid Buff: Increases the damage of allies within 15y by 6%
* Uses a weave window
* Stacks multiplicatively with other damage buffs
* In raid boss fights are used during the third GCD in your opener and on cooldown throughout the fight. Only delay its usage if your group is coordinating raid buffs
* In dungeons use on trash and bosses do not save it unless trash will die very soon

![](/img/jobs/ast/astrodyne.png)

**Astrodyne**

* Astrodyne grants a buff depending on unique seals in your Arcana Gauge
* You need three seals in your Arcana Gauge to activate Astrodyne no matter the unique seals
* Uses a weave window
* This buff grants effects based on the number of unique seals you have.
             
       * At least one unique seal gives you 2,500mp over 15s.
       * At least two seals give you 10% haste.
       * At least three seals increase your outgoing damage and healing by 5%.
       * Aim to get at least 2 unique seals to get the haste buff, while it's ideal to get 3 unique seals, it's not always optimal to redraw for it and the damage buff is a small gain compared to the haste buff.
* Haste isn't the same as spellspeed so it will not increase DoT damage
* You can hold Astrodyne for the 2 minute window, your 6 minute window will have two Astrodynes if you do this. I suggest looking at Astrodyne and Cards timeline for an idea on how 2 minute Astrodyne works.
* Overwriting cards in the Arcana gauge is never worth it unless you know you won't gain another Astrodyne before the fight ends.
