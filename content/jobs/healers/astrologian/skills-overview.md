![](/img/jobs/ast/003559_hr1.png)

**Gravity II**

* AoE damage in a 5y radius around your target  (130 potency), 1.5 cast time

![](/img/jobs/ast/003554_hr1.png)

**Combust III**

* Single target DoT (10 ticks of 55 potency), instant cast
* Total potency: 550
* Combust is a gain on 4 targets, and a lost on 5+ targets compared to gravity.
* Try not to refresh Combust early, losing ticks of Combust is a bigger lost than trying to fit it into buffs
* If Optimizing: 
          *Refreshing Combust early can be a gain if you know your kill/phase time and you know you will lose ticks anyway.*
          Combust is a gain on Fall Malefic after 5 ticks.

![](/img/jobs/ast/lightspeed.png)

* While Light speed makes your cast time instant, it isn't a dps gain you don't cast more spells outside of the last malefic before a fight ends.

* If you are colorblind, melee cards have a + to the side of the card while ranged cards have a little o to the side of the card
* Playing cards while you and your target are both in combat will give you a seal in your arcana gauge

* Uses a weave window
* Stack multiplicatively with other damage buffs
* In raid boss fights use during the third gcd in your opener and on cooldown throughout the fight. Only delay its usage if your group is coordinating raid buffs.

![](/img/jobs/ast/astrodyne.png)

**Astrodyne**

* Astrodyne grants a buff depending on unique seals in your Arcana gauge
* You need three seals in your arcana gauge to activate Astrodyne no matter the unique seals
* Uses a weave window
* This buff grants effects based on the number of unique seals you have.
               *At least one unique seal gives you 2,500mp over 15s.*
               At least two seals give you 10% haste.
              * At least three seals increase your outgoing damage and healing by 5%.
* Aim to get at least 2 unique seals to get the haste buff, while it's ideal to get 3 unique seals, it's not always optimal to redraw for it and the damage buff is a small gain compared to the haste buff.
* Haste isn't the same as spellspeed so it will not increase DoT damage
* You can hold Astrodyne for the 2 minute window, your 6 minute window will have two Astrodynes if you do this I suggest looking at Astrodyne and Cards timeline for an idea on how 2 minute Astrodyne works (Link here?)
* Overwriting cards in the Arcana gauge is never worth it unless you know you won't gain another Astrodyne before the fight ends.
