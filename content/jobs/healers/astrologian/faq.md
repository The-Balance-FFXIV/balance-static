  - question: What about Macros?
    answer: >-
      **MACRO ABILITIES ARE NEVER OPTIMAL FOR AST, EVER.**\

      (except for /ac gtoff on Star, that one's okay)


      That exception being what is being referred to as a "macro GCD" in order to frame 1 target a new entity. Useful for phase transitions and after downtime mechanics! 


      Otherwise, this includes your (mo)s and (t)s and (me)s. If they help you, that's great, but do not delude yourself into thinking they are `optimal`. 


      This is because macros cannot queue. 


      And while we are *very* aware of a certain Third Party Tool that lets us queue macros, we cannot recommend it both because it is very much, by definition, cheating (it is not a way anyone would be able to play the game without third party assistance). As well as there is great risk at this program breaking at any point, especially early in a patch. 


      And now, with 3 separate plays, the # of macros and HUD clutter has tripled if you choose to use them. 


      If you wish to make a macro set as training wheels, or simply accept their inherent flaws and propensity to cause problems, that is totally okay. Again, just accept that they can, and will, cause problems.
  - question: "What about SpS? "
    answer: You can still go quite fast this expansion. MP management can get tight
      at 2.32/2.31 and min Piety, but it is still sustainable without excessive
      raising or healing. Do be mindful of what your situation is (progression,
      farming, PF) and what you are most comfortable handling speed-wise, as
      slower speeds are more competitive and often even can edge ahead of faster
      speeds in Dawntrail.
  - question: How does Lightspeed work now?
    answer: It still does not increase our DPS by itself, but simply give us free
      weave space. However, now with 7.01, we get a free one to use once every 2
      minutes. We still need one for the opener, but now we can also use one
      charge for movement between bursts.

# What Sect Should I Use?

Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn't put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.

# What about Macros?

**MACRO ABILITIES ARE NEVER OPTIMAL FOR AST, EVER.**

Does not matter what it is. If it's Star, if it's cards, if it's Malefic (heavens no), macros should never be desired. If using any, the goal should ALWAYS be to work out of needing them. Yes, this includes you controller players. I play on it without any macros, you can too.

There is one set of macro types I will excuse under the condition that using them, the player understands:

1. It is objectively unoptimal and is costing them DPS and performance
2. They are training wheels that should be worked out of ideally
3. They will likely cause hiccups with queueing at times and discombobulate you
