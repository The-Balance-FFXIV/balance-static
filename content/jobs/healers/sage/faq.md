  - question: Is Toxikon a dps gain?
    answer: Toxikon is DPS-neutral on one target at level 90 and a DPS gain on 2+
      targets if you already have a Toxikon charge. Using Eukrasia Diagnosis and
      then Toxikon is a loss on multiple targets compared to Dyskrasia.
  - question: What is the purpose of Pepsis, will I be using it a lot?
    answer: No, Pepsis is a utility button but not something you will be using as
      part of your healing rotation. It's a good way to clear shields if an
      incoming AoE needs it and your shields may fall off right before it
      happens.
  - question: Can I double weave after my DoT?
    answer: No, Eukrasia has a 1s recast, while the following spell has 1.5s recast
      time. You can only single weave after the second spell.
  - question: Do shields stack?
    answer: >-
      The image below shows conflicting shields and which shields win out,
      anything not listed will stack. (Thanks to Meru for the image.)

  - question: How do I fit Phlegma into 2-minute buffs?

      cooldown works with buff windows. Be aware fitting in your second Phlegma
      in 2-minute buff windows is really tight."
