      Going slower doesn't work as well for week 1 sets even for SGE due to the
      spell speed from crafted gear and the tome bracelet, which is one of the
      better tome pieces to buy. 



      2.39 sets sim higher for bis with Sage this tier due to tiering. Max Damage sets have lower ilvl, while you may rarely die due to having a lower ilvl that isn't very realistic.
