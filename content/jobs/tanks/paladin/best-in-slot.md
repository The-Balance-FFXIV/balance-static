# Paladin Best in Slot

## Gear Priority and Pre-BiS

Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS will otherwise not be maintained on this page. Use the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make your own gearing decisions based on personal loot availability. Prioritizing item level over substats is encouraged while learning new encounters.

Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS. If a prog set is too fast for personal preference, it is usually best to simply play around it until better gear is available, instead of using lower item level gear to reach a preferred speed.

However, if progression gear does not provide enough skill speed for personal preference, it is recommended to meld skill speed (even if significant melding is needed) because this will allow for more consistent play without sacrificing primary stats.

## Level 80 Ultimate

Augmented Law's Order weapons (515) or Blade's weapons (535) are optimal for synced content. Both have similar tiering in this content, so fully-upgrading the weapon is not essential, but Blade's weapon may reduce the dungeon grind if available:

## Level 70 Ultimates

For level 70 ultimates, simply sync any level 80 gear with critical hit + determination and enough skill speed for personal preference at or above ilvl 418 (UCoB) or ilvl 470 (Ultima). Melds on synced gear are ignored, but built-in stats will be capped if the gear's original item level is high enough.

Certain non-synced gear pieces and Augmented Law's Order weapons (515) or Blade's weapons (535) are optimal for 4.X content. Use the level 70 sync module in the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to compare gear options precisely.
