      Note: 665 relic can be used in place of 645 relic (no stat change due to
      sync)


      If you do not have the Ultimate sword, use the 645 or 665 relic sword (with Crit + Det > Ten) and replace dungeon ring with 660 tome ring.

      This gearset is a whopping ... 10 dps (less than 0.5%) better than just
      using crit+det gear at i595 or higher â€” If you do not have the specific
      gear pieces already, it is highly recommended to not bother with them at
      all (the relic weapon itself is worth around 25 dps, but still not
      recommended if you have to grind it from scratch)

      Note: For the above set, you can use Aug. Deepshadow Necklace instead of Edengrace Earring if desired.
