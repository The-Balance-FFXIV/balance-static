# Paladin Leveling in Dungeons
# Keeping Aggro



Turn on Iron Will and never turn it off. As long as you keep hitting the mobs, you will have aggro on them. In multi-target situations, use AoE so that you can keep aggro on all mobs.


# Pulling Mobs



There are a variety of ways to ensure you pull all of the mobs in a pack quickly and reliably, without stopping on your way to the next pack of mobs.  



* Run up to the mobs so they see and run to you and hit an AoE combo GCD once they are in range to secure aggro.
* Tab through the mobs and use Shield Lob while weaving any damaging oGCDs or Provoke.
* Try to position the mobs so that they are in a tight clump: this lets you, your DPS, and your healers use their AoE damage more effectively. 
* Pull melee enemies onto ranged enemies so that the ranged enemies are also in the clump. Alternatively, drag mobs around a corner so the ranged enemies are forced to run next to you in order to attack.



# Mitigation



Cycle through your mitigation on trash pulls (they hurt more than bosses). Rather than using it all at once, keeping something up at all times can help your healer keep you alive more easily. More powerful mitigation cooldowns like Rampart, Sentinel, and Arm's Length can be paired with weaker ones like Reprisal or Sheltron.



Hallowed Ground is your most powerful dungeon cooldown and should be used proactively where you expect to be taking the most damage, rather than saving it for emergencies. Aim to get at least two uses of Hallowed Ground in a single dungeon.

# Rotation



With Holy Circle unlocked, open trash pulls with Requiescat into Holy Circles + Confiteor, then spam Prominence combo under Fight or Flight and until the next Requiescat. On bosses, follow a normal single target rotation.


## Before Lv. 78:



Weave Requiescat late into the GCD to ensure it catches the end of your fifth Holy Spirit or Holy Circle, due to the cast time.


## Before Atonement is unlocked:



Replace Atonements in the single target loop with a Royal Authority combo.


## Once Goring Blade is unlocked but before Royal Authority is unlocked:



Since the base potency of Goring Blade is higher than that of Rage of Halone, Rage of Halone is not used until Royal Authority is unlocked (one Rage of Halone combo can be optionally used after Fight or Flight to avoid overwriting a buffed DoT with an unbuffed one for a minimal potency gain).
