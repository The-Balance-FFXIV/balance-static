# Dungeon Tips

## Keeping Aggro

Turn on Iron Will and never turn it off. As long as you keep hitting the mobs, you will have aggro on them. In multi-target situations, use AoE so that you can keep aggro on all mobs.

## Pulling Mobs

There are a variety of ways to ensure you pull all of the mobs in a pack quickly and reliably, without stopping on your way to the next pack of mobs.  

* Run up to the mobs so they see and run to you and hit an AoE combo GCD once they are in range to secure aggro.
* Tab through the mobs and use Shield Lob while weaving any damaging oGCDs or Provoke.
* Try to position the mobs so that they are in a tight clump: this lets you, your DPS, and your healers use their AoE damage more effectively. 
* Pull melee enemies onto ranged enemies so that the ranged enemies are also in the clump. Alternatively, drag mobs around a corner so the ranged enemies are forced to run next to you in order to attack.

## Mitigation

Cycle through your mitigation on trash pulls (they hurt more than bosses). Rather than using it all at once, keeping something up at all times can help your healer keep you alive more easily. More powerful mitigation cooldowns like Rampart, Sentinel, and Arm's Length can be paired with weaker ones like Reprisal or Sheltron.

Hallowed Ground is your most powerful dungeon cooldown and should be used proactively where you expect to be taking the most damage, rather than saving it for emergencies. Aim to get at least two uses of Hallowed Ground in a single dungeon.

# Rotation

This section will start at level 15, since that is the level requirement for the first dungeon. Each section will only cover the differences from the previous rotations.

## Level 15

**Single Target:**

* Alternate Fast Blade and Riot blade on the target. Use Fight or Flight late in the global cooldown after Fast Blade to fit an extra Riot Blade at the end of the buff window.

**Multi Target:**

* Spam Total Eclipse. Use Fight or Flight late in the global cooldown to fit an extra GCD in the buff window.

## Level 26

**Single Target:**

* Spam the Rage of Halone combo (Fast Blade, Riot Blade, Rage of Halone). Continue using Fight or Flight late in the global cooldown to fit the last Rage of Halone 9 GCDs in the buff window

## Level 30

* Use Spirits Within on cooldown. The first use and every other use afterwards should naturally fall within the Fight or Flight buff window.

## Level 40

**Multi Target:**

* Spam the Prominence combo (Total Eclipse, Prominence). Use Fight or Flight late in the GCD after Total Eclipse.

## Level 50

* Use Circle of Scorn on cooldown. The first use and every other use afterward should naturally fall within the Fight or Flight buff window.

## Level 54

**Single Target:**

* Use Goring Blade inside of the Fight or Flight buff window and on cooldown. Goring Blade does not break combo so you do not need to finish your current combo before using it.
* Since you will have some skill speed while leveling, you can late weave Fight or Flight after Fast Blade to fit 9 GCDs in the buff window (Goring Blade, Riot Blade, Rage of Halone, and two more Rage of Halone combos).

## Level 60

**Single Target:**

* Rage of Halone gets upgraded to Royal Authority.

## Level 64

**Single Target:**

* Royal Authority now grants Divine Might, empowering your next Holy Spirit. Only use Holy Spirit when you have the Divine Might buff.
* Holy Spirit, like Goring Blade, does not break combo.
* Your Fight or Flight window should now contain (in some order):

  * Goring Blade
  * 2x Royal Authority combo + Holy Spirit

## Level 66

* Use both charges of Intervene in the Fight or Flight buff window.

## Level 68

**Single Target:**

* Use Requiescat inside Fight or Flight, and spend the 4 stacks on Holy Spirit.
* Your Fight or Flight window should now contain:

  * Requiescat + 4x Holy Spirit
  * Goring Blade
  * 3x "combo" GCDs (Fast Blade, Riot Blade, Royal Authority, or Holy Spirit)
  * \*With so many spells in the Fight or Flight window, it is very difficult to get 9 GCDs in Fight or Flight and not worth worrying about
* It is usually possible to hold an earlier Holy Spirit into the Fight or Flight window, but be sure to:

  * Avoid overwriting the Divine Might buff; if Divine Might is available, always spend it before your next Royal Authority (e.g. Fast Blade, Riot Blade, Holy Spirit, Royal Authority is fine).
  * Keep using Fight or Flight on cooldown.

## Level 72

**Multi Target:**

* Prominence combo now grants Divine Might.
* Spend Requiescat stacks and Divine Might on Holy Circle in multi-target situations.
* Continue using Goring Blade in Fight or Flight; for maximum efficiency, there is usually an enemy with higher HP to use it on.

## Level 76

**Single Target:**

* At this point, you can use the level 100 [rotation](/jobs/tanks/paladin/basic-guide), replacing Confiteor and Blade of Valor combo with four Holy Spirits and Expiacion with Spirits Within. Divine Might-buffed Holy Spirit is stronger than Sepulchre at this level, so continue to prioritize placing Holy Spirit into Fight or Flight.

  * Your burst phase should now include:

    * Requiescat + 4x Holy Spirit
    * Goring Blade
    * 3 filler GCDs (Holy Spirit, Royal Authority, or Atonement/Supplication/Sepulchre)

## Level 80

**Single Target:**

* Replace the first Holy Spirit with Confiteor.

**Multi Target:**

* Replace the first Holy Circle with Confiteor.

## Level 86

* Spirits Within upgrades to Expiacion.

## Level 90

* Requiescat stacks should now be spend exclusively on Confiteor and the Blade of Valor combo. Do not spend them on Holy Spirit (if you have both Divine Might and Requiescat, Holy Spirit will consume only the Divine Might).

## Level 94

* At this level, Sepulchre becomes stronger than Divine Might-buffed Holy Spirit, so begin prioritizing Sepulchre in Fight or Flight over Holy Spirit

## Level 100

* Use the new Blade of Honor when available (it becomes ready upon using Blade of Valor)
