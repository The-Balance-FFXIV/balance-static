# Paladin Openers

Tanks currently use Grade 7 Tinctures of Strength 
(Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing).

## Alternative Rotations

These rotations drop Atonements or hardcast Holy Spirits to maintain a 1- or 2-minute loop. **Not recommended to use** â€” these are harder to learn and adjust, and there is practically 0 difference in DPS performance.

How to read: Execute the first line once, then keep repeating the entire loop section.

* 1-min loop: [https://xiv.sleepyshiba.com/pld/img/63-60stentative2.png](https://xiv.sleepyshiba.com/pld/img/63-60stentative2.png "https\://xiv.sleepyshiba.com/pld/img/63-60stentative2.png")
* 2-min loop (2.50 GCD only): [https://xiv.sleepyshiba.com/pld/img/63-120stentative1.png](https://xiv.sleepyshiba.com/pld/img/63-120stentative1.png "https\://xiv.sleepyshiba.com/pld/img/63-120stentative1.png")
