# Paladin Openers

Tanks currently use Grade 7 Tinctures of Strength 
(Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)

The choice of opener is encounter-specific and depends on factors such as when downtime happens, melee disengages and choice of strat, kill-times, etc. See the Encounter Optimization page (Coming Soon!) for encounter-specific optimization.
