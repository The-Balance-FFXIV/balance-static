## PALADIN IN DAWNTRAIL
Introduce the job - welcome to an extremely flexible tank, utility focus with smaller damage optimizations, etc.
## HARDCASTED HOLY SPIRIT
Discuss how hardcasts impact your overall fight timeline, how it can impact smaller uptime windows, and practical applications of it (perhaps referencing later in the fixed timeline segment).
## BLADE OF HONOR SMUGGLING
Discuss what Honor smuggling is, how to do it, its use within damage optimization, etc.
## FIXED TIMELINES
Use this section to talk about squeezing the most out of a known timeline. Talk about application delay and flexible Fight or Flight timing (as the previous guide had sections for), with the focus on teaching the reader how to create their own optimized windows.
## CLEMENCY
(maybe merge this section with cover too)
Discuss Clemency’s use in a prog setting as well as an optimized damage-focused environment. For prog, hammer home how damage does not matter for a while, and encourage readers to work with their healers to use Clemency to ease some burden early on. For an optimized damage-focused setting, discuss using it to allow healers more leeway during downtime mechanics. This section doesn’t have to be super in-depth, but I’d like to include it.
## COVER
Discuss Cover’s usage in both a progression setting and a more optimized setting, its relationship with other gauge cooldowns, and how you can and should be using the skill in multiple different examples. This section will probably include the most math to attempt to convince the reader that this skill is worth using more than most people would have you believe.
