## PALADIN IN DAWNTRAIL

For most of Paladin's lifetime, the job has been known for the players that spreadsheet and optimize each encounter. While the job has changed significantly since this reputation was gained, we can still live up to it. In this guide, I'll discuss smaller ways to improve your gameplay as Paladin, both for your damage, as well as the utility you bring to the raid. 
(this intro sucks please fix it later lol, idk what's bad about it i just don't feel great abt it and can't come up with anything better rn.)

## HARDCASTED HOLY SPIRIT

On paper, hardcasting a Holy Spirit is a strict potency loss. Our average filler combo GCD is 430 potency per GCD*, and each hardcast only deals 370 potency, due to the one second cast time costing us one second of auto-attacks. Despite this, there are still several applications in which hardcasting a Holy Spirit is worthwhile, ranging from fairly broad situations you may encounter frequently, to more niche applications that may only pop up occasionally.

So, what does hardcasting actually do? When you hardcast a Holy Spirit, you are using a ranged, non-combo GCD, that does not break combo. What this means is that ALL your future combo actions will be delayed by a GCD for the rest of the encounter. How can we use this to our advantage?

The most common use for hardcasting is replacing a Fast Blade, Riot Blade, or full Royal Authority combo at the very end of a fixed length of time. Replacing these actions is a potency gain only if you cannot use any resources gained by that full Royal Authority combo. If the boss would become untargetable, and we are consistently ending on any part of the Royal Authority combo, we may insert hardcasted Holy Spirits at any point before the phase ends to push those actions later, and out of the uptime phase entirely.

For example, if you were to end a phase after using Royal Authority, and you are unable to use Atonement or Divine Might Holy Spirit when a target returns, you could instead hardcast three Holy Spirits at any point beforehand. Where you choose to place these extra Holy Spirits is more dependant on fight circumstances, but some common places you could choose to place a hardcast are as follows:

1. If you are required to leave melee range earlier in the encounter, you could opt to hardcast at range.
2. You may hardcast to delay potentially stronger filler GCDs into an upcoming Fight or Flight window.
3. To delay when your next combo action is used, to carry combo through a downtime segment of 29 seconds or less, where doing anything else would force a combo break.

Other circumstances where hardcasting a Holy Spirit exist, but are much less common and are not worth mentioning in this guide due to how fight-specific and niche they are. For encounter-specific information, check The Balance Discord’s encounter channels.

## BLADE OF HONOR SMUGGLING

Discuss what Honor smuggling is, how to do it, its use within damage optimization, etc.

## FIXED TIMELINES

Use this section to talk about squeezing the most out of a known timeline. Talk about application delay and flexible Fight or Flight timing (as the previous guide had sections for), with the focus on teaching the reader how to create their own optimized windows.

## CLEMENCY

(maybe merge this section with cover too)
Discuss Clemency’s use in a prog setting as well as an optimized damage-focused environment. For prog, hammer home how damage does not matter for a while, and encourage readers to work with their healers to use Clemency to ease some burden early on. For an optimized damage-focused setting, discuss using it to allow healers more leeway during downtime mechanics. This section doesn’t have to be super in-depth, but I’d like to include it.

## COVER

Discuss Cover’s usage in both a progression setting and a more optimized setting, its relationship with other gauge cooldowns, and how you can and should be using the skill in multiple different examples. This section will probably include the most math to attempt to convince the reader that this skill is worth using more than most people would have you believe.
