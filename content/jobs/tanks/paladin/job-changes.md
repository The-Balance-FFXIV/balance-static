    description: Big rework! DoTs removed, FoF shorter but buffs all damage, Royal
      Authority gives an empowered Holy Spirit, Requiescat now used exclusively
      on Confiteor combo, and Goring changed to a strong GCD with a one minute
      cooldown
  - patch: "6.4"
    description: Royal Authority, Atonement, Riot Blade, and Circle of Scorn buffed.
      Atonement no longer breaks combo so we can hold them for Fight or Flight

    description: Circle of Scorn, Requescat, and all 4 hits of the Blade of Valor
      combo are buffed by 20 potency. No gameplay changes.
