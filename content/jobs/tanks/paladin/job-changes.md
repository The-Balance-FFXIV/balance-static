      ### Summary


      * Iron Will - 10s cooldown -> 3s cooldown

      * Clemency, Holy Spirit, Holy Circle no longer break combos

      * 400p healing added to Confiteor and each hit of Blade of Valor combo

      * Blade of Valor combo works slightly differently: instead of comboing off of Confiteor directly, it becomes available for use whenever Requiescat ends (either the buff timing out or upon using Confiteor). This likely means that other actions can be used between Confiteor and Blade of Faith

      * No rotational changes!
