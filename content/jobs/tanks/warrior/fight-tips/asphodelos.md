Quick and dirty notes for non-speedrunners.  

**P1S:**  
* Nothing special. Full uptime fight.  
Holmgang big busters 1 and 4.  

**P2S:**  
* -9s Prepull IR might be a gain.  
However, it is possible to do a basic IC IR IC opener, and keep IR on cooldown while managing mechanics.  
* Yes, you can use IR before Limit Cut happens. You'll get 2-3 IR FCs out.  
* If you only got two IR FCs out, the third one will stay ready until the boss is back again.  

**P3S:**  
* Normal opener, or -29s into Rend. This is highly special tech though.  
* You can take all of the busters by rotating Thrill + Rampart / Vengeance, with Bloodwhetting.  

**P4S Phase One:**  
* -9s IR into Eye opener if you're going all the way to Enrage.  
* Normal opener if you have the DPS to push the fight down earlier.  
* Holmgang the busters, all the other cooldowns are free for auto-attacks.  

**P4S Phase Two:**  
* Nothing special here.  
* Normal opener, nearly full uptime depending on your group's strats.

**P5S:**
* You may skip Tomahawk and opt for an earlier IR. 
* Keep IR rolling and get 3 FCs off before Devour. 
* Save Primal Rend for after boss is targetable again.

**P6S:**
* Nothing special. Full uptime fight.

**P7S:**
* As with P5s, you may skip Tomahawk. Keep IR on cooldown. Fight lines up nicely with 2.45, as most of the knock-ups happen during GCD downtime.

**P8S Phase One:**
* Full uptime fight, apart from Dog 2 phase.

**P8S Phase Two:**
* Recommended 2.45 GCD. 
* -11s IR opener, get IR FCs + Primal Rend off before HC1. 
* Keep IR on cooldown for the most part. 
* On HC2, wait for the adds tethers and then use IR, reopen with 3 FCs. 
* Nearly full uptime fight.



**P9s:**

* Standard opener on 2.5 gives you perfect alignment for first kb and going into LC1 downtime
* As such, you can walk back in after the first kb and use your rend/onslaughts under raidbuffs beforehand
* Try to go into LC1 with as much eye as possible without overcapping so as not to drop. On 2.5 you will be refreshing at 29-30s. (on 2.5 you don't want eye to be your very last gcd before downtime as it will likely ghost, last gcd will be a fell cleave)
* You can press IR on cd during LC1 (it'll be tight, you can delay by a second if not confident), and 3x FC as soon as he's targetable. It may gain you a use of IR, but will also desync you from raidbuffs.
* Pot recs for most normal kts is opener and 6m
* Otherwise it's a full uptime fight. You can uptime LC2, as ranged players can all stand outside to bait all defamations by being furthest from boss (you can uptime as a defamation as well, but it's very spook)

**P10s:**  
* Mitigation is the most important optimization, see [spreadsheet](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R0PyFFwRgmJEMnu3U2p2-Kq4IYj9TGw6iUmV3P6A3u8/edit?usp=sharing).  
* See this image for [Tower knockback](https://github.com/Moxfi/XIV/blob/main/WAR/Encounters/P10s_tower_spot.png?raw=true).  
* Full uptime.

**P11s:**  
* Full uptime with nothing really specific. Vengeance optimization is the only thing we have available.
* Vengeance usage: -2s, 2:04, 4:36, 6:45, 8:49 (20 hits!!!)
* These uses also line up with incoming damage quite well.

**P12s1:**
* Depending on killtime, you would either prepop IR right before she is targetable post LC1, or ~9s/10s before she's targetable. If your kt is very fast such that you don't gain a use even with -9s, you wouldn't even bother and just do a standard reopener.  
* For plus/cross during Paradeigma 3, you can consistently get full uptime on 2.5 if you tomahawk pull and nobody early pulls.
* For either one, start at max melee as close to tower as possible, pop sprint halfway through castbar, run out right after getting a gcd off and before tower snapshots (it's the castbar), run back in as soon as castbar resolves, gcd twice, move out for plus/cross (diagonally for plus),  move back in for a gcd, back out for add bait. If you lose any uptime up to this mech you may be too late and miss tower. 

**P12s2:**  
* Mitigation plan is the only real optimization here.
* Full uptime, Primal Rend/Onslaught can be used during Caloric as long as you don't move.
* Remember to help the healers on Classical/Caloric. You're taking autos, you gotta heal!

Busters: 

* Holmgang the first tentacle buster. 
* Have WAR hold the boss nearly all of the fight. This leads to plenty of BW+Equilibrium spam. 
* Helm Crush 1: Ramp+Veng+Thrill+BW and healers' Esuna. If you have a PLD, Cover shenanigans are viable. 
* Holmgang the post-towers tentacle busters. 
* Helm Crush 2: Ramp+Veng+Thrill+BW and healers' Esuna!  

Raid wides: 
* Shake on first raidwide
* Reprisal pre-UAV1
* Shake on Classical1
* Reprisal post-Classical1
* Shake on pre-Exas
* Reprisal post-Exas raidwide
* Shake on Classical2
* Shake on pre-Exas
* Reprisal post-Exas raidwide
