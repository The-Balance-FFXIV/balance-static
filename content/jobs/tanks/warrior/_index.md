description: FFXIV Warrior Introduction

Warriors are the high-burst, low in between DPS tanks, with a high emphasis on Healing mechanics. The rotation is slow, the resource management is low, but the fun part is becoming the third healer in the 8-man party. Armed with the only party-wide flat-value shield, a healing basic rotation, a high-burst self-heal and a party member heal/mitigation tool, Warriors are capable of saving themselves, or party members, in case of missed heals or missing mitigation.
