# Warrior Openers and Rotation

Warriors prepare their burst while waiting for the party buffs to appear.  
After the buffs are up, the skills are used more or less in order of importance, as to gain potential re-uses towards the end of the fight.

## Opener Optimization

Assumed Timings:
* Tomahawk starts at -0.70s and the pull starts at 0.00s
* Party buffs are expected to be up at around 7.80s, right when the first Inner Chaos goes out.

Skill Speed requirements
* \>=2.47 or slower for skill-for-skill copy.
* <=2.45 and faster may move oGCDs slightly.

Potion
* Potion is expected to cover 12 GCDs at these Skill Speeds, from the first Inner Chaos right until the last Inner Chaos.
* Potion can cover 13 GCDs on a faster GCD speed. It is possible to use a Late Potion after Maim in these cases.

oGCDs
* Upheaval and Onslaughts are used late to catch Party buffs. 
* The expected timing for all buffs to be up is approximately 7.80s after Tomahawk lands.


#### All-Around Opener

The IR stacks last right until the 3rd Fell Cleave at 2.50 GCD. There's nothing special about this. This is your usual opener, probably.


## More on various openers

There are more "Early IR" openers, and they all have various niche use cases. For a short documentation on these, please see this [Google doc](https://bit.ly/dt-war-openers)

## Rotation Optimization

The basic rotation in a 100% uptime scenario is, generously put, a priority list:

* Keep the buff up. Generally refresh between seven and 15 seconds
* Don't overcap on buff
* Storm's Path to gain more gauge
* Don't overcap gauge
* Keep Upheaval on cooldown
* Keep Inner Release on cooldown
* Keep Onslaughts ticking (below three stacks)
* Keep Infuriate ticking (below two stacks)
* Burn gauge/stacks inside party buffs

The main goal for your rotation should be to maximize Storm’s Path casts and Storm’s Eye uptime, while pushing most of the available resources inside party buffs.
