  - question: What is wrong with my log? How do I improve?
    answer: >-
      First you check IR windows, just toss the log into XIVA and see what it
      tells you: <https://xivanalysis.com/>


      Second, I like to check GCDs outside of Eye buff. You can do this by selecting your name -> Damage done -> Events > Click the Eye button twice, until it gets a red outline. Make sure to discount the first three GCDs that you apply Eye.


      You can always take a log and compare it to another log of a high % player (remember to adjust killtime to be the same). Compare your casts with theirs and it should give you an idea of lost uptime and rotational mistakes.


      Next thing I like to check is how your IR aligns with raid buffs. You can do this by doing the same thing as above, but clicking the IR icon once instead. On the right hand side, it'll show which buffs were active when you landed your attacks. 


      Last thing I like to do, and this is the thing people hate doing, is go to "Casts -> Timelines" to check for errors in the rotation. Is Eye refreshed properly? Are Upheavals and ICs going in Trick? Do you lose Path casts? Too many Onslaughts?
  - question: How do I play WAR?
    answer: "[The 6.x Guide](/jobs/tanks/warrior/basic-guide/)"
  - question: What do I meld?
    answer: Check the [Stat Priority](/jobs/tanks/warrior/stat-priority/) page!
  - question: Why do we have any Tenacity in our equipment?
    answer: "Tenacity increases all damage dealt, much like Determination. While it
      offers some mitigation bonuses, it is often very little and near
      impossible to observe due to the game already having a 5% variance in
      incoming damage.  "
  - question: How much Skill Speed do I need?
    answer: "We don't need it. Maybe only for comfy reasons such as fight phasing or
      oGCD lineups etc.  \r

      oGCD lineups referring to situations where our GCD and oGCDs come up
      at the same time, forcing us to delay one or the other."
  - question: What happened to Warriors' weird melds?
    answer: Patch 6.2 made things better for most of us.
  - question: Food? Potions?
    answer: |-
      These can be found in the BIS sets, but here's a quick summary.

      As of patch 6.4:  
      Baked Eggplant HQ (Det>Crit), or  
      Baba Ghanoush HQ (Crit>SKS).  
      Grade 8 Tincture of Strength HQ.
  - question: When do I refresh the Surging Tempest buff?
    answer: >-
      Generally speaking, refresh the buff between 7 and 15 seconds.  

      Depending on the fight and downtime between phases, it may be beneficial to refresh the buff earlier, gathering 31-60 seconds of it.
  - question: What GCD / Skill Speed should I get?
    answer: >-
      Warriors can work with pretty much any GCD / Skill Speed. Most used ones
      are 2.50 (400-414 SkS), 2.45 (649-706 SkS) and 2.40 (941-999 SkS).  

      Main differences between the GCD speeds are how our weapon skills line up with our off-global cooldowns. The 2.50 setup rarely delays either our weapon skills or off-global cooldowns, whereas 2.45 and 2.40 come with some delays.  


      The best GCD speed is often a question of comfort and fights.

> *Lvl70: Single Target vs AoE (Two Targets)?*

[TL;DR: Very equal, but lvl70 ST wins by a small margin](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRqxeKcJJb0zc2Kh86mY222FLkV9r8YAByW-TzoPujokBy1DT4ofPlwpFhKN4K4uZWhrYLfHvo7Lz5g/pubhtml)

> *How do I relic?*

* Cap Crit, cap Det
* Check if you can replace any SkS melds in your gear with Det
* Get any missing SkS through relic
* Fill the rest of the relic with TNC

> *How do I Upheaval?*

All the time. I'm using Inner Release's recast timer as a visual guide whether to hit Upheaval or not.

Hit Upheaval at:\
-88s  \
-58s  \
-28s  

Because Upheaval drifts a bit, aim to hit Upheaval at:\
-88~85  \
-58~53  \
-28~22  

If your third Upheaval (per 90s timeframe) slipped out of the 22s, either skip it completely or replace it with Onslaught, depending on your preference and gauge needs.
