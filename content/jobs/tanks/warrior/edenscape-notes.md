# Warrior Edenscape fight-specific notes
by Ramza Beoulve’ of Leviathan


## E1S
- Early IR will become a thing as people kill adds faster and faster.  Doing facepull works just fine.  You are gated by the Delta Attack, so putting up eye is still good.
- Eden jumps to the corner that they’re farthest from, we pull Eden to the SE corner barely off from the middle, and it jumps to the NW everytime.
- Equilibrium after the first aoe gravity, this causes equilibrium to come back up during the bleed, helps a lot
- Can invuln 1st and 3rd spear, this makes it pretty braindead tbh.  Use shake for gravity AoEs, it gets silly value, especially when paired with Thrill BUT BE CAREFUL WITH THE TIMING


## E2S

- Invulning the second buster works very well for my group, as lots of movement + autos go out in the space before it, don’t take this as gospel.  
- Otherwise, equilibrium is up for every buster, and you can rotate Rampart+Thrill and Vengeance.  Reprisal is up for every buster.
- One of the tanks should use Reprisal on busters, the other on raidwides.
- IR comes up during one set of Flares.  If you’re in PF, pray they mitigated.  But you can use Shake + Reprisal in order to mitigate the damage and not delay.
- Alternatively, delay IR by a full combo (reapply Eye) and pray your buff window didn’t drift all over the place. NOT A FAN OF THIS but it’s an option I guess.
- Doing IC IR IC works for upheaval timings on some movement/dodges, works very well for me to not delay it.


## E3S
- You can invuln AT LEAST 3 of the 4 busters with any tank combination.  You can invuln 3/4 with WAR + PLD or GNB, with a DRK, you can invuln all 4.
- IC IR, and do heavy + maim for first buster to be able to full heal combo yourself after buster (Thrill + equilibrium , 2 IC under Nascent)
- 2.36 gcd allows finishing your combo before Leviathan jump, storm’s eye is preferred. You can do 3 onslaughts and end phase 1 with 30 gauge, then start P2 with eye, path, eye and immediately IR, this will cause you to go into the large 2 minute buff window with fresh storm’s eye and full gauge.
- At lower GCD speeds (2.38, 2.37), ending Phase1 at 0 gauge is also an option. Fell Cleave into Heavy Swing, Leviathan jumps away. Reapply Eye when Phase2 starts, go IR. In this case, it’s pretty much a re-opener, so remember that extra Onslaught.
- Shake will be up for both Stormy Horizon and Tsunami 2, so plan around this.
- You can solo heal yourself through black smokers with proper nascent, thrill, and equilibrium usage.
- You can heal your co-tank across the arena with Nascent Flash, if both of you are close enough to the inner edges. 
- Holding your 2nd IR until the next set of 2 minute buffs doesn’t cost you a usage, and let’s you take advantage of any 2 minute buffs (tell your monk this too)


## E4S
- IC IR IC to get out IR asap to aid in tight fight timings with IR in phase 1.  You can also do the full heal combo after your buster, should healers prefer it.
- Check clips of P1 IR use in WAR_Lounge
- There is an IR that comes up during a possible awful combination after the second megalith stack, delay if you might be forced off the boss.
- You have about 1 minute of IR wiggle room if you’re seeing enrage, so don’t delay anything too much.
- Invulning the double fist buster in P3 frees up healer stress and is a solid use of the cooldown, just shirk afterwards.
- Rampart will be up for each set of merry go rounds between the tanks, so swap accordingly.
