Universal Stat Priorities are:  
* Weapon Damage >>> Main Stat >>>> Substats.  
* Very few exceptions have existed before Endwalker.  

Early Expansion (pre-7.05):
* Comfy SkS > DH > Crit
* This results in mostly DH melds across the gear
* This priority changes once we get more Crit from gear, supposedly in patch 7.05

Warrior Substat priority and melds:  
* Crit > Comfy SkS > DH >= Det > TNC
* Be mindful of stat tiers when melding.

Skill Speed
* We don't need it, but we might still want some. 
* Mostly for comfy reasons such as fight phasing or oGCD lineups etc.
  * oGCD lineups referring to situations where our GCD and oGCDs come up at the same time, forcing us to delay one or the other.
