Universal Stat Priorities are:  

* Weapon Damage >>> Main Stat >>>> Substats.  
* Very few exceptions have existed before Endwalker.  

Warrior Substat priority and melds:  

* Crit > Comfy SkS > DH >= Det > TNC
* Be mindful of stat tiers when melding.

Skill Speed

* We don't need it, but we might still want some. 
* Mostly for comfy reasons such as fight phasing or oGCD lineups etc.

  * oGCD lineups referring to situations where our GCD and oGCDs come up at the same time, forcing us to delay one or the other.
