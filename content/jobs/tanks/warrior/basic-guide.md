@Balance Discord





## Intro


Hello team!
There should be an intro here, but I am bad at writing those.

## Warrior Gameplay

Warrior gameplay focuses on gathering resources and maximizing the effectiveness of those resources.  
These resources are Beast Gauge, and with some imagination, our buffs and oGCD stacks.  
  
First off, the important parts to get your gameplay flowing.





### Openers

Warrior openers are all about catching the party buffs, and maximizing potential amount of uses per skill.  

There is some flexibility, mainly in Potion timings and the use of Primal Rend, but also when IR is used. This means that we’re delaying some skills until after all the party buffs are up, while also making sure to get them all on cooldown as soon as possible.    
While exact timings are not often important to 99% of the player base, we will still follow them as Best Practices™.

Assumptions:

* Tomahawk starts the pull at 0.00s. This means that the actual use of Tomahawk is at around -0.7s, right before the pull timer hits 0.
* Skill Speed is at around 532, which translates to 2.47 GCD. Faster skill speed is fine, but the openers listed will be slightly different in practice due to some skills having flat timers (Upheaval at 30s) and our GCD speed being flexible (2.50 to 2.30).
* Potion covers 12 GCDs. It is definitely possible for Potion to cover 13 GCDs, but due to Endwalker Warrior being such a slow-paced job in general, and players having wildly different internet connections, we will show openers with 12 GCD Potions.
* All of the important Party buffs are up after 7.8s into the pull. 

Syntax

* GCDs are on the lower part of the image.
* oGCDs and potions are on the upper part of the image.
* Going forward, all the skills will be listed as _GCD +oGCD1 +oGCD2._

#### Basic IC IR IC
Catches party buffs, however the 2nd Inner Chaos is tight with Trick Attack.  
There's nothing special about this. This is your usual opener.

![IC IR IC Opener](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583965306071023616/917968991706841108/unknown.png "IC IR IC opener")


The order of actions is:

		Tomahawk +Infuriate
		Heavy Swing
		Maim +Potion
		Storm’s Eye
		Inner Chaos +Upheaval +Inner Release
		Primal Rend +Onslaught
		Fell Cleave +Onslaught
		Fell Cleave +Onslaught
		Fell Cleave +Infuriate
		Inner Chaos
		Heavy Swing
		Maim
		Storm’s Path
		Fell Cleave +Infuriate
		Inner Chaos
		Heavy Swing
		Maim +Upheaval
		Storm’s Eye




#### Basic IC IC IR

Our strongest skills catch all the buffs, including Trick Attack.  
However this comes at the cost of delaying IR by a GCD. 
Nothing special apart from the slight IR+Rend delay.

The order of actions is:

		Tomahawk +Infuriate
		Heavy Swing
		Maim +Potion
		Storm’s Eye
		Inner Chaos +Upheaval +Infuriate
		Inner Chaos +Inner Release +Onslaught
		Primal Rend +Onslaught
		Fell Cleave +Onslaught
		Fell Cleave
		Fell Cleave
		Heavy Swing
		Maim
		Storm’s Path
		Fell Cleave +Infuriate
		Inner Chaos
		Heavy Swing
		Maim +Upheaval
		Storm’s Eye

#### Cursed Prepull IR

The cursed tech of “Prepull IR” refers to getting Inner Release on cooldown before the pull has even started.  
This has some very big downsides, and some very situational up-sides.

**Do not use these unless you know what you’re doing.**

The main reasoning for the opener is to get IR on cooldown faster, gaining extra uses before specific fight phases.  
An example of this would be a heavy-padding Zodiark Extreme, where the aim is to get Inner Release for the Orbs phase.

Pull timers are:


	IR at -00:09s
	Potion at -00:02s
	Pull at 00:00s

The previews have been removed to force the reader to read the text above, before clicking random links on the internet.

We expect you to do your own adjustments for any fight-specific needs. There is no support for these openers.




### Rotation

The Endwalker Warrior rotation is mostly a priority system with some flexibility baked in. The short version can be summarized as follows:

* Keep hitting things
* Keep the buff up
* Don't overcap on buff
* Storm's Path to gain more gauge
* Don't overcap gauge
* Keep Upheaval on cooldown
* Keep Inner Release on cooldown
* Keep Onslaughts ticking (below 3 stacks)
* Keep Infuriate ticking (below 2 stacks)
* Burn gauge/stacks inside party buffs

That’s a lot of things that you might not know about, so we’ll break it into their own sections.

#### Combos and breaking them
* Thanks to Endwalker, dropping a combo is really difficult now.
* Combo actions last 30 seconds before dropping.
* You can use Tomahawk and Gauge spenders between combo pieces.
* The only way to break the combo is to use a GCD from another combo, or to use the same combo GCD twice, or to use an earlier combo piece.

#### Surging Tempest - The Buff
* +10% damage buff that we keep up.
* Granted by Storm’s Eye combo, or Mythril Tempest combo
* Aim to refresh between 7-15 seconds.
* Stacks up to 60s. Use this to your advantage in fights with forced downtime.
* Inner Release gives +10s to the buff. Keep this in mind when refreshing your buff.

#### Storm's Path and Storm's Eye
* Use Storm's Eye combo to get the buff up.
* Use Storm's Path combo to get more gauge.

#### Beast Gauge
* Used for Fell Cleaves and Inner Chaoses.
* Don't throw the gauge away, try to spend it inside party buffs.
* Don't overcap. Using Storm's Path at 90 gauge gets you to 100 gauge. You can't have 110 gauge.
* Spend all of your gauge inside party buffs. Gather gauge between party buffs.

#### Onslaught
* Very useful as a Gap Closer, meaning that we can stick to the boss even when knocked back.
* We can stack up to three of them. They're on a 30s timer.
* We can do some fancy optimization around party buffs!
* With the current party buffs being mostly 120s, we aim to do 3-1 cycles of Onslaughts.
* Three Onslaughts into the opener, One Onslaught while waiting for the buffs to come up again.
* Repeat 3-1, 3-1. Three inside even minute buffs, One inside odd minute buffs if available.
* Don't let them sit on full stacks for long. That's DPS loss.

#### Infuriate
* We get two stacks, on a 60s timer.
* Unlocks Inner Chaos for 30 seconds.
* Spend them in party buffs. That's what they're for.
* It is possible to carry the Inner Chaos for 30 seconds. Do not drop it.

#### Upheaval
* Should be used on cooldown. It's on a 30s timer, meaning that it should hit every party buff.
* As long as those buffs are up every 60/120 seconds, that is.
* Doesn't matter if it's inside Inner Release or not, as IR only affects Weaponskills now.

#### Inner Release
* Our "Free Fell Cleaves" button.
* Using ANY GCD (except Rend) spends the stacks. We get three stacks, no more. Stacks last for 15 seconds.
* Having a single Stack lets us negate Knockbacks.
* Inner Release should be used **ONLY** on **Fell Cleaves**, or **Decimates**.
* Do not use Inner Chaos inside Inner Release. Unless the fight is about to end.
* Do not use Infuriate inside Inner Release. Unless the fight is about to end.
* Use IR on cooldown. Unless the fight downtime would waste it.

### Area of Effect

Area of Effect refers to using skills that hit multiple targets in one go. The AoE skills themselves have a lower potency than Single target skills.   
So what’s the big deal?

For Endwalker Warriors, the options are pretty clear-cut.  
At Lv90, the AoE rotation for Warriors is more effective than Single target rotation if there are 3 or more targets to hit.

Here’s a nice table comparing various skills and combos, and their effective potency at different situations.

![AoE effectiveness](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/583965306071023616/926218374885806140/unknown.png "AoE effectiveness")

That’s a bunch of numbers, and Warriors are known to be bad at reading, so let's summarize:

Three or more targets available?
* Overpower + Mythril Tempest
* Decimate or Chaotic Cyclone
* Orogeny

Two or less targets available?
* Storm’s Eye / Storm’s Path
* Fell Cleave or Inner Beast
* Upheaval









## Getting Advanced

That’s it for the very basics. Now, you might feel like Warriors haven’t got a lot of optimization going on, and you’d be right.  
However, there are some tricks in our sleeves that can be used.

### Beast Gauge

Warrior's gauge should not be spent willy-nilly. There must be a reason for using the gauge.

A couple of rules to mention first:
* We cannot reach >=110 gauge. This will be referred to as "overcapping".
* Maim gives +10 gauge.
* Storm's Path gives +20 gauge.
* Storm's Eye gives +10 gauge.
* Surging Tempest cannot reach >60 seconds. This, too, will be "overcapping".
* Infuriate gives +50 gauge.

With those rules in mind, we want to maximize our Beast Gauge generation, as our main sources of damage are locked behind Beast Gauge.

#### Avoiding overcapping:
* Do not use Storm's Path at 90-100 gauge. Fell Cleave first.
* Do not use Infuriate at 60-100 gauge. Fell Cleave first.
* Do not use Storm's Eye at >31 buff timer. Use other GCDs first.

Some exceptions exist, but if you're reading these notes, you might not know any yet. These are often fight-specific.

You may want to consider emptying your gauge as much as possible, before using Infuriate.  
This will let you use Infuriate, and carry the Inner Chaos into a later moment. More about this slightly later in this same section, under “Carrying Buffs”.

#### Using Beast Gauge

Beast Gauge does not expire. This means that we can stock up for party buffs, and empty it all once there are buffs to take advantage of.  
You may feel compelled to use that 50 gauge on a Fell Cleave as soon as possible. As mentioned above, there is no reason to do so.  
You often lose out on free damage that could've been gained by saving that Fell Cleave for buff windows.

You should avoid overcapping as much as possible. This is achieved by using single Fell Cleaves every time your next GCD would make you overcap on your gauge.  
  
Sitting at 100 gauge, and the next combo GCD is Maim/Path/Eye?  
Better Fell Cleave first.

#### Inner Release and Infuriate timer

It is beneficial to avoid hitting two full stacks of Infuriate, as to gain the full advantage of the timer ticking.  
Therefore, we may run into moments where our Infuriate would hit two stacks during Inner Release.  

To avoid hitting 2 stacks of Infuriate, we will do the following maths:
* Inner Release lasts for 3 GCDs (2.50s each) => 7.5s
* Each Fell Cleave pushes the timer forward by 5 seconds => 15s
* A total of 22.5s

Having over 50 gauge pushes this timer forward by yet another GCD, that would be Fell Cleave. A total of 30s.  
As a note, this math expects that a single Fell Cleave pushes the Infuriate timer by 7.5 seconds (2.5s GCD + 5s Infuriate Trait)

So, to avoid hitting two Infuriate stacks during Inner Release, the following timers apply

		<=50 gauge?
		Infuriate should be >22 seconds away.

		>=60 gauge?
		Infuriate should be >30 seconds away.








### Stacking Cooldowns

Most of the game can be solved by stacking cooldowns in such a way that our “Survivability” increases by ~35%.

Consider the following situation:

		Tank buster will hit for 100% of our HP.
		Warrior has all their cooldowns available.
		Thrill of Battle is used. Warrior’s MaxHP is now 120%.
		Rampart is used. Tank buster now hits for 80% of the original.


The gap between the new MaxHP and the new Tank Buster is now “40%”.

While maths does not work this way exactly, it’s good enough to paint a mental image of the survivability increase.

![Cooldowns vs Buster](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/937834268950925433/947118361198854175/unknown.png "Cooldowns vs Buster")


As another example, consider Bloodwhetting + Rampart.


		Tank buster for 100% of MaxHP.
		Rampart reduces it down to 80%.
		Bloodwhetting reduces that down to 64,8%
		100 x (1 - 0.2) x (1 - 0.19)
		= 100 x 0.8 x 0.81 \
		= 80 x 0.81
		= 64.8

The original tank buster of 100% now hits for 64.8% -- a reduction of 35.2%.

#### Usual Sets of Cooldowns

As for practical uses, we assume a good use of the Bloodwhetting - Granting us a total of 19% mitigation for 4 seconds.

##### Sets of 2

		Bloodwhetting + Thrill of Battle
		Bloodwhetting + Rampart
		Bloodwhetting + Vengeance
		*Bloodwhetting + Reprisal

##### Sets of 3

		Bloodwhetting + Thrill of Battle + Rampart
		Bloodwhetting + Thrill of Battle + Vengeance
		*Bloodwhetting + Reprisal + Rampart
		*Bloodwhetting + Reprisal + Vengeance
		*Bloodwhetting + Reprisal + Thrill of Battle

##### Sets of 4

_also known as Kitchen Sink**_

		Bloodwhetting + Thrill of Battle + Rampart + Vengeance
		*Bloodwhetting + Reprisal + Rampart + Vengeance
		Just Holmgang at this point, honestly.

Anything with a Reprisal* in them is considered _very situational_, and should be used with care.  
If you’re using Reprisal to survive a tank buster, remember that it might be down for the next raidwide damage.  

Other sources of 10% mitigation exist, such as Exaltation on Astrologians.

_Kitchen Sink comes from the idiom “Everything but the kitchen sink”._  
[What does "Everything but the Kitchen Sink" mean?](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/everything-but-the-kitchen-sink)  
_We are throwing **everything** at the problem._ 








## The Optimization

Warrior Optimization focuses on manipulating the Surging Tempest buff refreshes, and “Carrying buffs” such as Nascent Chaos and Primal Rend Ready.  
There’s also the case of pushing out “3 IC Pot” windows, and “2 IC Tricks”.

### Surging Tempest 

Using Storm’s Eye or Mythril Tempest in a combo grants us 30 seconds of the Surging Tempest, buffing all of our damage by 10%.  
This buff can be stacked up to 60s, giving us some breathing room for various optimization reasons.

While Warriors often aim to refresh the buff between 7 and 15 seconds, there are moments when it’s desirable to refresh right after the buff hits 30 seconds.  
These moments include Fight Downtime, and manipulating our gauge in a very minor way.  
For example, using Storm’s Eye combo twice in a row grants us 40 gauge, but also risks overcapping the buff itself.  
 
In the situation that we would have 50 gauge, or use Infuriate, the total sum of gauge would be at 90.  
This lets us push Fell Cleave / Inner Chaos further:

		Heavy Swing (90g)  
		Maim (100g)  
		Fell Cleave / Inner Chaos (50g) 


For comparison, using Storm’s Eye and Storm’s Path combo grants us 50 gauge. 
This would change the situation above slightly, as we would hit 100 gauge earlier, forcing us to use Fell Cleave or Inner Chaos.

Some fights also favour stacking up 30+ seconds of Surging Tempest right before any downtime occurs.  
This would let us skip getting the buff back up once the boss reappears, giving us the option of using Inner Release right off the bat.

The gauge gained from Storm’s Path is quickly outvalued by being able to use Inner Release faster, making it possible to gain an extra use before the fight ends, or before yet another downtime.  
Or you know, having our burst right inside the party buffs, instead of being delayed by the GCDs you’d use to put up the Surging Tempest.

### Carrying Buffs

With Inner Release'd Fell Cleaves being less impactful than Primal Rend and Inner Chaos, it may sometimes be worth it to carry these big hitters into a later moment.

Using Inner Release unlocks Primal Rend for 30 seconds. If the fight favors using Inner Release early, but Party buffs are coming up later, you may want to carry that Rend into the buffs. A moment like this would be when the fight makes us use Prepull IR openers, but the party buffs still came up at the usual time.

Emptying the Beast Gauge and using Infuriate puts us anywhere between 50 and 90 beast gauge. This lets us carry Inner Chaos into a slightly later moment, when party buffs would be up. 

Be mindful about the gauge, as you don't want to overcap; unless you know what you're doing, in which case why are you reading this?

Regarding Inner Chaos and Infuriate, it is possible to hit the following rotational milestones:

* Infuriate has one stack, and ~15 seconds until the second stack
* We have 100 gauge
* Even-minute buffs are coming up

These milestones would let us empty our beast gauge, hit Infuriate, and carry it until party buffs.
* Empty the gauge (0g), Infuriate hits close to 0s
* Hit Infuriate (50g - 90g), Inner Chaos is unlocked
* Gather more gauge with Storm’s Path, or refresh the buff
* Keep gathering gauge while carrying the Inner Chaos
* Make sure to take advantage of Heavy Swing not giving any gauge
* Spend the Inner Chaos, hopefully inside Party buffs

Congratulations, you just carried Inner Chaos for multiple GCDs.

### Potions

Warriors have a couple of tricks up their sleeve when it comes to potions. Three is more than Two, but there are things to consider.

Depending on the kill time and fight downtimes, Warriors aim for the following Potions:

#### Three Potion Windows:

	Prepull Window:
		-00:02 Potion
		00:00 Pull
		04:30 Potion
		09:00 Potion


	Standard Window:
		00:00 Pull
		00:05 Potion
		04:35 Potion
		09:05 Potion

#### Two Potion Windows:

	Prepull into 6 Min:
		-00:02 Potion
		00:00 Pull
		06:00 Potion

	Standard into 6 Min:
		00:00 Pull
		00:05 Potion
		06:00 Potion

The Two Potion Windows can be extended to Three Potion Windows by using the third one at 10:30 or 11:00.

Note:
Talk with your party regarding your potion timings. Some jobs and fights favour different timings.

## Disrespecting mechanics

Since the beginning of FFXIV, the game has worked on simple boolean logic checks.

		Player 1 took damage? Give them a debuff.

Not all fights work like this, but a good handful of them do. This lets us disrespect some mechanics that would force us to disengage from the boss.

The main check that the game uses is “Loss of Health”, or “Mechanic’s Damage Done was >0”. This means that mitigating a hit by 100% often works wonders.  
Shame that Warriors don’t have Superbolide or Hallowed Ground. So what are our options then? Shields.

Shake It Off and Bloodwhetting both offer shields to Warriors.  
If we were to mitigate a hit enough so that it only scratched our shields, we would “Zero Out” the entire mechanic, and most likely any debuffs that come from it.  
Endwalker’s first raid tier, Pandaemonium, comes with a fight that lets us do just that.  
There have been similar opportunities before, but we’ll use a more relevant example here.  
  

Towards the midway point of the fight, the entire party gets to handle a mechanic where everybody has to sit tight inside a tiny safe square, while also managing a Stack Hit, and two Knockback Hits.  
The two Knockback Hits are always on a Tank, and a DPS. The usual way to handle this is to have the entire party right next to the boss, while the DPS player hides in the corner of the arena, and the tank hides in another corner of the safe area.

Not being in the safe area means getting hit by the Cataract mechanic, which gives a Damage Down debuff if the player takes damage from it.  
_IF the player takes damage from it…_

### Zero Out the P2s Cataract

Doing the maths for NOT taking any damage from Cataract, with the following assumptions:

		Cataract hits for 42000 damage
		Warrior has 80000 MaxHP
		All cooldowns are available

Cataract hits for 42000

		Rampart mitigates the hit to 33600
		Vengeance mitigates that to 23520
		Bloodwhetting mitigates it even further, to 19051

WAR has 80000 HP

		WAR uses Thrill, increasing their MaxHP (80000 x 1.20 = 96000 HP)
		Shake it Off gives a Shield of 16320 (15% +2% of MaxHP)

Bloodwhetting gives us a ~5k Shield

		Total shield increases to a Shield of 21320 (16320 + 5000)

Moment of Hit

		Cataract (3 CD) reduced to 19051 damage
		Shake it Off (Thrill'd) gives a Shield of 16320
		Bloodwhetting’s shield increases the total Shields to a total of 21320

Leftovers


		(Shield - Damage) must be >0 to avoid the debuff:
		= 21320 - 19051
		= 2269

You just spent 4 CDs to disrespect a mechanic, gaining a GCD or two. On the other hand, you didn't risk wiping the raid for uptime.

_Now take the following Tank Buster solo with Holmgang, because you have nothing else available._

This is something that is actually used in weekly re-clears and speedruns, as it leaves more room for the rest of the party while also letting us stay in and hit the boss. 
Just don’t get hit by two Cataracts.






## Wanted: Party Buffs

Warriors are kind of picky eaters when it comes to party buffs and debuffs. We don’t care much for the Critical Rate% buffs such as Chain Stratagem or Battle Litany, or Direct Hit Rate% buffs such as <bard songs, dancer things>, because a good chunk of our kit already has 100% Direct Crit rate.

Inner Chaos? 100% Direct Crit.  
Primal Rend? 100% Direct Crit.  
Inner Release’d Fell Cleaves? 100% Direct Crit.  

Nice buffs for Warriors are Damage Increase% buffs such as

		Brotherhood (MNK)
		Arcane Circle (RPR)
		Divination (AST)
		Radiant Finale (BRD)
		Mage’s Ballad (BRD)
		Technical Step (DNC)
		Embolden (RDM)
		Searing Light (SMN)
		*Dragon Sight (DRG)
		*Arcana Cards (AST)
		*Standard Finish (DNC)

Nice debuffs-on-boss for Warriors are also Damage Increase% debuffs such as

		Trick Attack (NIN)

Nice-but-not-as-nice buffs and debuffs are the Crit Rate% and DHit Rate% changes such as

		Battle Litany (DRG)
		Chain Stratagem (SCH)
		Army’s Paeon (BRD)
		Wanderer’s Minuet (BRD)

_It’s not worth it to list them all here, since a good handful of our kit does not get anything out of these._  
_*Asterisk buffs are often given to DPS players, but there are times when someone feels like buffing the little Warrior._







## Healing

Warrior is the third healer of the party. 
With Bloodwhetting, Equilibrium, Nascent Flash and Shake It Off, we are blessed with the responsibilities of saving people who stand in stupid.
In this section, we will go over the very basics of Warrior Heals.

### Thrill of Battle
* Affects Storm's Path's healing.
* Affects Shake it Off's healing.
* Affects Equilibrium's main heal and the HoT.
* Does affect the Bloodwhetting's shield.
* Does NOT affect Bloodwhetting heals.
* Weird like that

### Bloodwhetting
* Get 4 GCDs in by popping this in the 2nd oGCD slot.
* Heals per hit, very powerful in dungeons.
* May Crit a heal randomly. Luck!
* Primal Rend, Chaotic Cyclone and Inner Chaos always force a Crit heal.
* Inner Release'd Fell Cleaves do NOT force a Crit heal.
* Thrill of Battle does NOT increase the healing from these.
* Initial mitigation is 19% due to diminishing returns (100 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 81).

### Nascent Flash
* Goes on a friend
* Initial mitigation is 19% due to diminishing returns (100 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 81).
* Gives them the mitigation, much like Bloodwhetting would give to us.
* Save a friend with this!

### Forcing Crits
* Inner Chaos and Primal Rend force a Crit heal.
* This may save a life.
* Be the healer of the party.
* Inner Release’d skills do not force a Crit heal.






## Stats and Gear

Welcome to Endwalker Warrior stats and gearing! 
Soon you’ll have all sorts of confusion, and question various things you’ve heard in various parts of the Internet!

First things first:

* Warriors are Strength-based. Vitality is nice, but it always walks hand in hand with Strength upgrades. 
* We don't exactly want Direct Hit because of our skills, which is why Tenacity gives bigger gains. 
* A single Direct Hit meld may be god-like for that one parse, but on average Tenacity wins out. 

For the God Parse, you will want that one DH meld - because only the BEST parse matters.  
Statistical averages aren't ranked, only the high-end outliers.

### Universal Stat Priorities
Weapon Damage >>> Main Stat >>>> Substats.  
_Very few exceptions have existed before Endwalker._

### Warrior Substat Priority
_Crit > Det > Tnc_  
Also applies to Materia Melds.

#### Why is Direct Hit not desirable? 
Direct Hit as a stat only increases the DH Rate% of the skills, and not the damage.  
As we have multiple skills that already have baked-in Direct Hit, any DH melds quickly lose value, giving Tenacity a chance to shine (dimly).

#### Skill Speed
We don’t deliberately avoid Skill Speed, but we don’t prioritize it at all. Maybe only for comfy reasons such as fight phasing or oGCD lineups etc.  
oGCD lineups referring to situations where our GCD and oGCDs come up at the same time, forcing us to delay one or the other. A rule of thumb is to delay the oGCD in most situations.

#### Why Tenacity?
Tenacity increases all damage dealt, much like Determination.  
While it offers some mitigation bonuses, it is often very little and near impossible to observe due to the game already having a 5% variance in incoming damage.

#### Determination vs Tenacity
To gain +0.1% damage, we need to reach the next breakpoint.  
We will refer to these +0.1% gains as "tiers".  
These tiers are separated from each other approximately as follows:
* 13.57 points of Determination
* 19 points of Tenacity

To extrapolate from this, it follows that Determination gives us more damage than Tenacity, when limited to an arbitrary amount of stat points.  

If we were to have 2000 points to use on either Determination or Tenacity, we would get:
* 2000 / 13.57 = ~147 tiers of Det
* 2000 / 19 = ~104 tiers of Tnc




#### Multi-tank melds
Do you play other tanks? This would be called “Omni-tanking”.  
Meld WAR, use DH in non-WAR weapons.  
Consider melding SkS somewhere if your other tanks need it. WARs don't.  
Better Omni-tank writeups exist, but they are not a part of this guide.







# Macros

Macros are weird. They are fired off One Line per One In-Game Frame.  
15 lines of Macro, 15 FPS in-game? That macro is gone in a single second.
Macros also don’t queue like normal skills do.

Filling up all the slots with repeating lines sort of simulates queuing.  
The real reasoning is that macros read one line per each in-game frame.  
If the macro tries to execute an action while in animation lock (from another action, for example), it has no effect.

		Frame 1: /merror off
		Frame 2: /ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		Frame 3: /ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		Frame N: ...

So when you repeat the action inside the macro, you stretch the action activation window.
Instead of a macro that has a single frame where it attempts to use an action, you have a macro with 13 frames of attempts. 
This gets around the issue of "Animation Lock vs Macros" where you might not be able to use a skill because of the Animation Lock.

## Holmgang

Holmgang is weird.  
If your Holmgang target dies, you lose the effect. Self-cast gets around this.  
If your target is too far away, you won't be able to cast Holmgang. Self-cast gets around this, too.  
To achieve both goals, we self-cast using <me> in the macro!


		/merror off
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/ac "Holmgang" <me>
		/micon "Holmgang"

## Nascent Flash
Nascent Flash goes on a friend. Most often on the co-tank of your 8-man party.  
They are, by default, the 2nd member in your party list, which is what the <2> refers to.  
You may make a Mouse-over macro by using <mo>, or you may make multiple macros for each of your party member by using <3>, <4>, etc.

		/merror off
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/ac "Nascent Flash" <2>
		/micon "Nascent Flash"

## Shirk
Shirk the 2nd Party member. Often your co-tank.

		/merror off
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/ac "Shirk" <2>
		/micon "Shirk"

Ring has 2x SkS melds due to stat tiering. This results in around +12 dps gains.  

#### What’s the difference? Why not just use the one with the highest simulated DPS?
The simulations are made with a simulated infinite rotational loop, which also heavily skews the value of skill speed.  
Also #1: fights are not infinite, and often come with downtime.  
Also #2: slower GCDs offer some rotational tricks to maximize Party buff windows.
