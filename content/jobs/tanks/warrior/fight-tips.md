Quick and dirty notes for non-speedrunners.  

**P1s:**  
Nothing special. Full uptime fight.  
Holmgang big busters 1 and 4.  
  
**P2s:**  
-9s Prepull IR might be a gain.  
However, it is possible to do a basic IC IR IC opener, and keep IR on cooldown while managing mechanics.  
Yes, you can use IR before Limit Cut happens. You'll get 2-3 IR FCs out.  
If you only got 2 IR FCs out, the third one will stay ready until the boss is back again.  
  
**P3s:**  
Normal opener, or -29s into Rend. This is highly special tech though.  
You can take all of the busters by rotating Thrill + Rampart / Vengeance, with Bloodwhetting.  
  
**P4s phase 1:**  
-9s IR into Eye opener if you're going all the way to Enrage.  
Normal opener if you have the DPS to push the fight down earlier.  
Holmgang the busters, all the other cooldowns are free for auto-attacks.  

**P4s phase 2:**  
Nothing special here.  
Normal opener, nearly full uptime depending on your group's strats.
