  - question: What GCD speed is optimal for Gunbreaker?
    answer: >-
      Gunbreaker functions at realistically any speed, but generally prefers
      2.50. There can sometimes be a few benefits to running a faster speed
      though, depending on available gear stat types and the encounter. Faster
      speeds such as 2.40 tend to be easier for progging purposes because it
      provides additional leeway for mistakes due to it possessing cooldown
      reduction for your GCD cooldowns, and more resource generation in any
      given fight, making burst phase preparation easier. The tradeoff is that
      you will typically do about 1% less damage in the average Savage encounter
      than 2.50 would.



      We generally advise 2.50, 2.45, and 2.40 due to the fact that those three speeds in specific are respective playstyle breakpoints that do not drift No Mercy. Any speed inbetween these ranges will introduce drift to No Mercy to some extent.
  - question: How difficult is this job in comparison to other tanks?
    answer: >-
      All tank jobs follow a generally consistent rotational pattern of
      building/spending every minute with some variation of that for the 120s
      burst. Gunbreaker is only "harder" than the others in that it has some
      specific constraints that can make it less flexible around certain
      encounters, such as the fact that it is the only tank job to currently
      have hard GCD cooldowns like Gnashing Fang and Double Down to manage.


      In practice, the job works in every piece of content the game has to offer and can even be an insightful experience for learning how to play at a higher level for end-game optimization.
  - question: How weave intensive is this job, and can you do a single-weave rotation?
    answer: >-
      The job is more weave-intensive than other tanks, and some GCD speeds have
      ping requirements that you may not be able to meet, such as 2.45 requiring
      less than around 50 ping to successfully execute without clipping your
      GCDs when starting the burst phase.


      Single-weave rotations are possible now due to the removal of Rough Divide in Dawntrail. It may prove difficult to consistently execute a single-weave rotation during periods of high tank damage due to the necessity of mitigation usage, but this can usually be accomodated for by shuffling cooldowns/burst timing/mitigation timing around.
  - question: Is it worth it to hold No Mercy to secure better GCDs in No Mercy when
      I don't have Bloodfest?
    answer: >-
      The "odd minute" burst phase that doesn't have Bloodfest has three to four
      extra GCDs that end up being filler actions, and so some people get the
      idea that it is optimal to hold that burst phase to make sure they
      maximize what ends up being buffed out of those four GCDs. In unplanned
      environments, this decision is almost never worth doing.



      In a timeless fight, every GCD you hold your burst phase ends up losing 1/24 of a future burst phase. This loses more average DPS than the buffed GCD gains, unless you already know how the fight timeline plays out and you have determined that you do not lose cooldown usages from delaying. You can still lose average DPS even if you do not lose cooldown usages from the fact that you will push GCDs out of party raid buffs by delaying your burst phase.
  - question: I heard it’s hard to move bosses as GNB? Is this true?
    answer: Yes, if you’re inexperienced. Some bosses are easier to move than
      others. However, this again stems from experience in stutter stepping
      between continuations to move the boss.
  - question: What if Gnashing Fang became misaligned from No Mercy because of
      downtime or user error?
    answer: >-
      Follow this flow:


      Less than 17s on No Mercy: Hold Gnashing Fang, or it will be pushed out of No Mercy.


      More than 17s on No Mercy: Use Gnashing Fang, because it will come up during the latter half of No Mercy.
  - question: Can you die while casting Superbolide?
    answer: With the modification to application times of invulns in Dawntrail, they
      apply almost instantaneously (whatever time it takes for your request to
      use the invuln to reach the game server). You should never encounter a
      situation where you die after pressing your invuln.
  - question: What does Tenacity do, and why do tanks tend to minimize its use?
    answer: >-
      Tenacity has two effects that scale at different rates, with the first
      effect being a damage bonus that increases your damage by 0.1% per tier
      (similar to Determination), and the second effect being a mitigation bonus
      that decreases your damage taken by 0.1%.


      The damage reduction scales relatively quickly, which can be valuable in situations where damage isn't required (which usually isn't the case, so we don't prioritize this since our mitigation will cover the fight with or without Tenacity).


      The damage boost scales somewhat slowly, at a rate equal to 80% of the tiering rate of Determination. This means that you get less damage boost per stat point invested, albeit not by a great difference.


      Since every encounter can be covered by mitigation tools without any Tenacity, there's no reason to sacrifice damage on best-in-slot sets (or progression sets) for week 1 sets or parsing parties and potentially risk missing a DPS check that you could have made by having better stats on your gear.


      You shouldn't avoid Tenacity as a rule, though. If you have higher item level gear that has Tenacity, it's definitely better than your lower item level gear.
