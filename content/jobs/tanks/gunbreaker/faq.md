qna:
  - question: Do I hold Bloodfest for No Mercy?
    answer: No. Bloodfest is a 90s CD and NM is 60s, meaning they’ll eventually line
      up if both are used on cooldown. Holding Bloodfest frequently will cause
      you to lose usages and in turn lose damage. You should only hold usages if
      they are a damage gain, and losing a usage is rarely actually a gain.
  - question: I heard it’s hard to move bosses as GNB? This true?
    answer: Yes if you’re inexperienced. Some bosses are easier to move than others.
      However, this again stems from experience in stutter stepping between
      continuations to move the boss.
  - question: What if I misaligned my Gnashing Fang from No Mercy because of
      Downtime/user error?
    answer: >-
      Don't worry! This happens. It's going to happen to all of us. Follow this
      flow:


      Less than 17s on No Mercy? Hold Gnashing Fang or it will be pushed out of No Mercy.


      More than 17s on No Mercy? Don't hold Gnashing Fang because it will come up during the latter half of No Mercy.
  - question: Is it worth changing my rotation/opener to secure more Hypervelocity
      uses in No Mercy?
    answer: Hypervelocity is 180 potency, 216 under No Mercy which is a 36 potency
      gain. It’s not substantial enough to change the rotation or risk moving
      harder hitting abilities later which may result in missing No Mercy’s
      buff.
  - question: Can I do a single weave rotation?
    answer: Can you? Yes. But you will still be forced to double weave at some point
      so you should look at fixing the issues forcing you to single weave for a
      better experience. If your latency is bad enough that double weaving is an
      issue, try moving a necessary weave to be paired with **Savage Claw**, as
      this weaponskill has the lowest animation lock of any GNB action, and plan
      weaving mitigation in before your burst to avoid having to press too many
      buttons.
  - question: I heard GNB is clunky and bad to play, is this true?
    answer: That’s the opinion of some players but that’s all it is, opinion. Others
      have the opinion that it’s fun. Play it and decide for yourself.
  - question: Should I stack more SkS to get 9GCDs in NM?
    answer: It’s hard to answer this question conclusively for every situation, but
      yes more SkS is an option. However, there are other factors in regards to
      getting 9GCDs in NM. Hitting NM at the right time in the GCD clock, your
      latency and SkS are all contributing factors. See the “No Mercy” section
      for more info on this.
  - question: I heard Tenacity is useless, is this true? Some pieces are higher IL
      but they have tenacity so should I just avoid them to get more Crit/Det?
      Is Det better than DH now that it's buffed? Why do some gear sets have a
      single Ten Meld?
    answer: >-
      1) Tenacity contributes dps at only a slightly worse rate than
      determination. Unlike piety on healers, which contributes zero dps, it is
      almost never worth it to lower your item-level to avoid tenacity.


      2) Det did get buffed but the contribution of DH is still very good for GNB due to us not getting it naturally in our gear. Det is an option, but DH is still a strong stat for us despite the Det buff.


      3) Sometimes a Tenacity meld is used to break a stat tier. What this means simply is that when you have enough of a stat you go up a tier which means your baseline damage goes up. Tenacity breaking a tier through a single meld can offer a bigger DPS gain than say a DH or Det meld in that spot. This doesn’t happen often but it is something you will notice from time to time.
  - question: I only had 2 carts going into No Mercy. Do I hold NM and generate a
      3rd cart or just go into NM and delay Double Down?
    answer: You should not be entering No Mercy with 2 Carts. If you did, it meant
      you did an unnecessary Burst Strike earlier on or you weren’t doing enough
      Solid Barrel combos. You have more than enough time to do 3x Solid Barrel
      combos before No Mercy is ready. In that situation there’s nothing you can
      really do to fix it. You can enter No Mercy and then continue your ammo
      combo and generate a 2nd cart to land Double Down, however this moves
      Double Down in your NM window and loses a burst strike and is something
      you’ll have to account for in future NM windows. Unfortunately GNB’s
      solution for mistakes is just “Deal with it and don’t let it happen in
      future pulls.” due to how strict the rotation is.
  - question: " I used Superbolide but died anyway, why? I was told it puts you to
      1HP first and then gives you the invuln?"
    answer: This isn't necessarily true. Reality is your HP was likely very low and
      the damage of the enemies snapshotted before Bolide added the buff, this
      can happen to any Invul as they all have a delay and as such if damage is
      applied before the buff, you'll be KO'd. This isn't exclusive to
      Superbolide.
