# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

> *What food and potions should I be using on GNB?*

Highest level strength potions available. Always use HQ. Food will vary from tier to tier based on what foods are available, but usually it will be Crit/Det food or Crit/Skill Speed food.

> *Should I be using X opener if Main Tanking (called Primary Tank in some regions)??*

Being Main or Off Tank (Primary or Secondary Tank) does not affect what opener you use. You will almost always be using the standard raid buff opener \[see #gnb_resources] unless there is a fight specific opener for a fight. 

> *Gnashing Fang is ready earlier and earlier before No Mercy, why is this happening?*

See the [Rotation Priority System part of the main GNB guide](https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/gunbreaker/#priority-system).

> *Do I hold Bloodfest for No Mercy?*

See the [Bloodfest part of the main GNB guide](https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/gunbreaker/#bloodfest).
