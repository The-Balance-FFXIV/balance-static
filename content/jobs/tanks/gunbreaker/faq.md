  - question: When do I use non-raid buff opener/X-Y-Z oGCD in this weave slot
      instead of that weave slot?
    answer: >-
      Moving abilities such as Blasting Zone, Rough Divides, Bow Shock etc, even
      using No Mercy earlier in your opener will be entirely dependent on your: 


      * Comp 

      * Kill time 

      * Phases -

      * # of uses. 


      Gub responsibly!
  - question: Can't I just use one opener for every fight?
    answer: You *could*. It just wouldn't be the best choice per fight. The strength
      of Gunbreaker comes in its versatility. We will teach you how to make that
      an asset for you!
  - question: What if I misaligned my Gnashing Fang from No Mercy because of
      Downtime/user error?
    answer: >-
      Don't worry! This happens. It's going to happen to all of us. Follow this
      flow:


      Less than 17s on No Mercy? Hold Gnashing Fang or it will be pushed out of No Mercy.


      More than 17s on No Mercy? Don't hold Gnashing Fang because it will come up during the latter half of No Mercy.
  - question: Am I using No Mercy too early?
    answer: "[Weave it like in this picture.](https://i.imgur.com/VEV9uhQ.png)"
  - question: Why is my combo breaking? OR Can I use X during my rotation?
    answer: |-
