  - question: What food and potions should I be using on GNB?
    answer: "Highest level strength potions available. Always use HQ. Food will vary
      from tier to tier based on what foods are available, but usually it will
      be Crit/Det food or Crit/Skill Speed food.\r

      \r\n"
  - question: Should I be using X opener if Main Tanking (called Primary Tank in
      some regions)??
    answer: "Being Main or Off Tank (Primary or Secondary Tank) does not affect what
      opener you use. You will almost always be using the standard raid buff
      opener (see #gnb_resources) unless there is a fight specific opener for a
      fight.\r

      \r\n"
  - question: Gnashing Fang is ready earlier and earlier before No Mercy, why is
      this happening?
    answer: "See the [Rotation Priority System part of the main GNB
      guide](/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/gunbreaker/#\
      priority-system).\r"
  - question: Do I hold Bloodfest for No Mercy?
    answer: See the [Bloodfest part of the main GNB
      guide](/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/gunbreaker/#bloodfest).
