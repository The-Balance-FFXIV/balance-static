    description: These sets were generated during week 1 of the Cruiserweight Savage
      tier. They were generated to preview what a player could bring as an
      entry-level set while spending as little as possible on tomestones, and
      assumes they were gated to only being able to acquire a limited number of
      normalmode raid pieces per week.
