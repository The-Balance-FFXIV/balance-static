# FAQ

> *Why do the GNB Ultimate BiS Sets use the i515 Resistance Weapon instead of the i535??*

The i535 weapon only gives +15 more substats over the 515. This is not enough to hit another tier in any stat for any of the ultimates. Because of this, there is functionally no difference between them and you are free to use whichever you want/have available.

> *The non-relic weapon TEA bis has the TEA weapon, what do I do if I don't have the TEA weapon yet?*

The Edengrace Manatrigger is equivalent to the TEA weapon, minus one meld slot. Use the 475 Edengrace Manatrigger if you do not have the TEA weapon.


> *Help! I don't have X piece for Unending Coil of Bahamut (UCoB) BiS?!*

That's okay! Substats on gear cap at iLvl 418 in UCoB. Simply use any piece of gear iLvl 418 or higher that has the same substats. They'll be the same when synced!

> *Help! I don't have X piece for The Weapon's Refrain (UWU) BiS?!*

That's okay! Substats on gear cap at iLvl 470 in UWU. Simply use any piece of gear iLvl 470 or higher that has the same substats. They'll be the same when synced!


> *Why doesn't X piece have materia?*

Any piece of gear that gets item level synced has its materia nullified, effectively meaning those pieces materia slots are useless.
<br>Any piece that is i345 and under in UCoB, i375 and under in UWU, or i475 and under in TEA, will gain full value from their respective materia!
