# Leveling AoE  Guide

This guide will teach you when to use your AOE skills while you are engaged in leveling content. You should generally follow these rules:
- You should be using **No Mercy** off cooldown while in combat, unless doing so would waste most of it's active duration (e.g. mobs during a dungeon pull have almost died.)
- You should be using all of your damaging off-GCD cooldowns such as **Blasting Zone** and **Bow Shock** on any number of enemies.
- You should be positioning yourself to strike as many targets as possible.
  - You can manipulate enemies into stacking closer together by walking a short distance away to cause them to follow you. This will help you and your team during dungeon pulls.
  - Consider pulling enemy mobs into your party member's negative effects, such as Ninja's **Doton**.

## __Levels 1-25__
- Use **Demon Slice** at 2+ targets.

## __Levels 26-39__
Unlocks **Solid Barrel** and **Burst Strike**.</br>
</br> Your **powder gauge** will finally be usable here, and ideally you want to hold onto your resources for **No Mercy**. This means that you will typically not use **Burst Strike** unless the next combo action will overfill the **powder gauge**, or **No Mercy** is active.
- Use **Demon Slice** at 3+ targets.
- Stop using **Burst Strike** at 3+ targets.

## __Levels 40-59__
Unlocks **Demon Slaughter** and **Sonic Break**.</br>
</br> \* With **Sonic Break**, it is important to evaluate that this action becomes increasingly worse to use if a target dies before it's full value applies to a target. Keep this in mind when considering using it during a multi-target pull, as it may no longer be worth using. Some basic rules of thumb for it's usage that have been derived from uptime simulations in multi-target scenarios are located at the bottom of the page.
- Use **Demon Slaughter** combo at 2+ targets.
- Stop using **Burst Strike** at 3+ targets.
- Stop using **Sonic Break*** at 7+ targets when it unlocks.

## __Levels 60-71__
Unlocks **Gnashing Fang** and **Continuation**.</br>
</br> **Gnashing Fang** is a powerful single-target combo that should be used off-cooldown and one usage per minute should always be inside **No Mercy**. Make sure to have gauge resources available for this whenever it becomes ready.
- Stop using **Gnashing Fang** at 4+ targets from level 60-69.
- Stop using **Gnashing Fang** at 6+ targets at level 70.
- Same rules regarding **Demon Slaughter**, **Burst Strike**, and **Sonic Break**.

## __Levels 72-83__
Unlocks **Fated Circle** and **Bloodfest**.</br>
</br> **Bloodfest** should only be used when the gauge is empty. **Bloodfest** is typically used inside **No Mercy**.
- Use **Demon Slaughter** combo at 2+ targets.
- Use **Fated Circle** at 2+ targets.
- Stop using **Gnashing Fang** at 4+ targets.
- Stop using **Sonic Break*** at 5+ targets.

## __Levels 84-100__
Unlocks multiple potency-modifying traits, **Hypervelocity**, **Double Down**, **Fated Brand**, and **Reign of Beasts**.</br>
</br> **Double Down** and **Reign of Beasts** should always be used within **No Mercy** both as part of your single-target and multi-target rotation. This completes your single-target burst phase with **Gnashing Fang**, **Double Down**, **Reign of Beasts**, and **Sonic Break**, which leads to interesting optimization at level 100 due to **Fated Circle** becoming more powerful than **Gnashing Fang** and **Sonic Break** within **No Mercy** beyond 3 and 4 targets respectively.
- Prioritize **Double Down** when it unlocks.
- Prioritize **Reign of Beasts** when it unlocks.
- Use **Demon Slaughter** combo at 3+ targets.
- Use **Fated Circle** at 2+ targets.
- Same rules regarding **Gnashing Fang** and **Sonic Break***.
  - At level 100 and 3+ targets, it can potentially be a gain to hold **Gnashing Fang** and replace it with 3 **Fated Circle** casts during **No Mercy** with **Bloodfest**.
  - At level 100 and 4+ targets, the same is true for **Sonic Break**.
  - The use of the word "potentially" here is important, as permanently moving **Gnashing Fang** out of **No Mercy** is a bad idea for long, dynamic encounters with no downtime to reset cooldown position like most dungeons provide.

At level 100, **Gnashing Fang** is technically a very small loss at 3+ targets when running an AOE-only rotation to a purely infinite duration, but there are a high number of dynamic AOE scenarios that can exist (uneven add health reducing target count on death, thrown off cooldown alignment by moving this action around resulting in future loss, etc.) that would show this action being a gain when used off cooldown on up to 3 targets, so this is what we feel should be the *average* recommendation for most short encounters around 30 seconds in length or anytime one of the 3 targets is nearly dead.
  - A good time to consider using **Fated Circle(s)** in place of **Gnashing Fang** at 3 targets is whenever the 3-target AOE encounter will last for more than 30 seconds, or at minimum, whenever skipping or holding a usage would not negatively impact **Gnashing Fang's** alignment throughout the rest of the fight and cause lost usages (or some form of loss within﻿ **No Mercy**).


With **Sonic Break**, you should consider how close the target is to dying when deciding on how important it is to apply the action. At level 100, the following bullet list applies for multi-target scenarios, but it is going to depend at lower levels. This advice will still be a generally good rule of thumb for any level, however.
- At 4 targets, do NOT use this if you suspect **Sonic Break** will not last for it's **entire duration**.
- At 3 targets, do NOT use this if you suspect﻿ **Sonic Break** will not last for at least **half** of it's duration.
- At 3+ targets, it is a gain to hold and then use﻿ **Sonic Break** out of **No Mercy** if it will let you use another﻿ **Fated Circle** in it's place, as long as no DoT time is lost.
