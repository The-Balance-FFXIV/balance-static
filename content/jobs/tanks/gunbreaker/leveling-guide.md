# Leveling Guide



Like any other class you may have to do lower level content and of course will need to Level from Level 60 to Level 90 if forgoing a jump book so it’s important to keep on top of GNB especially at Level 70 due to sync for **The Weapon’s Refrain (Ultimate)** and **The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate).**

**No Mercy** is unlocked at Level 2 so it’s used in all forms of content from the beginning of A Realm Reborn up to current content in Endwalker. No Mercy is standard and should be used on cooldown, though the abilities and weaponskills available to you will expand as your level increases.



# Level 15-29

One to Two Targets:

* Solid Barrel Combo: Keen Edge ➔ Brutal Shell ➔ Solid Barrel

3+ Targets:

* Demon Slice spam

# Level 30-39

One Target:

* Cart Generation: Solid Barrel Combo
* Dump carts with Burst Strike
* Enter No Mercy with 2 carts, Burst Strike spam and continue with the above priority

Two Targets:

* Demon combo
* Continue to use Demon Combo instead of Burst Strike at **3 Targets.**

# Level 40-59

* Same as Lvl. 30-39
* Sonic Break is unlocked at Lvl. 54, Rough Divide at Lvl. 56 and are to be used inside your No Mercy windows

# Level 60-71

As you gain access to the Gnashing Fang combo at Lvl 60. you want to use one of your stored carts for the combo instead of a burst strike. Gnashing Fang is every 30s so it will be available for No Mercy if used on cooldown.



One Target:

* Cart Generation: Solid Barrel Combo
* Gnashing Fang Combo + Danger Zone every 30s
* Rough Dividex2, Bow Shock + Sonic Break under No Mercy
* Burst Strike additional carts to avoid overcapping



Two Targets:

* Cart Generation: Demon Combo
* Gnashing Fang Combo + Danger Zone every 30s
* Rough Dividex2, Bow Shock + Sonic Break under No Mercy
* Burst Strike additional carts to avoid overcapping

3 Targets:

* Cart Generation: Demon Combo
* Gnashing Fang Combo + Danger Zone every 30s
* Rough Dividex2, Bow Shock + Sonic Break under No Mercy
* Only use carts for Gnashing Fang Combo



4+ Targets:

* Cart Generation: Demon Combo
* Danger Zone every 30s
* Rough Dividex2, Bow Shock + Sonic Break under No Mercy
* Ignore carts

*Fated Circle is unlocked at Lvl. 72, as a result it cannot be used in **UCoB** or **UWU**. Keep this in mind for phases where you do multi-target; Garuda, Ifrit, UCoB Adds. In this case Burst Strike to avoid overcapping on 2 targets, ignore carts on 3.*

# Essentially at Level 80:



A lot of the guide’s core rules are applicable at Lvl. 80, such as the rules of Bloodfest, Continuation and No Mercy. The only differences between Lvl. 80 to Lvl. 90 are the lack of a third cart, no Hypervelocity and no Double Down, but the rotational rules still apply.
