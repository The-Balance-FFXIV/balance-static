# Leveling Guide

Like any other class, you may have to do lower level content and of course will need to Level from level 60 to level 90 if forgoing a jump book. So, it’s important to keep on top of GNB, especially at Level 70 due to sync for **The Weapon’s Refrain (Ultimate)** and **The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate).**

**No Mercy** is unlocked at level 2, so it’s used in all forms of content from the beginning of A Realm Reborn up to current content in Endwalker. No Mercy is standard and should be used on cooldown, though the abilities and weaponskills available to you will expand as your level increases.

# Level 15-29

1-2 Targets:

* Cast the **Solid Barrel** combo.

3+ Targets:

* Cast **Demon Slice**

# Level 30-39

1 Target:

* Cast the **Solid Barrel** combo.
* Cast **Burst Strike** when the gauge is full or **No Mercy** is active.
* Enter **No Mercy** with two cartridges.

2+ Targets:

* **Demon Slaughter** combo
* Continue to use the **Demon Slaughter** combo instead of **Burst Strike** at **three targets.**

# Level 40-59

* **Sonic Break** is unlocked at level 54 and procs when casting **No Mercy**.

# Level 60-71

As you gain access to the **Gnashing Fang** combo at level 60. you want to use one of your stored cartridges for the combo instead of a **Burst Strike**. **Gnashing Fang** is every 30s, so it will be available for **No Mercy** if used on cooldown.

1 Target:

* Cast the **Solid Barrel** combo.
* Cast the **Gnashing Fang** combo + **Danger Zone** every 30s.
* Cast **Bow Shock** + **Sonic Break** under **No Mercy.**
* **Burst Strike** excess cartridges to avoid overcapping.

2 Targets:

* Cast the **Demon Slaughter** combo.
* Cast the **Gnashing Fang** combo + **Danger Zone** every 30s.
* Cast **Bow Shock** + **Sonic Break** under **No Mercy.**
* **Burst Strike** excess cartridges to avoid overcapping.

3 Targets:

* Same as 2 targets, but stop using **Burst Strike**.

4+ Targets:

* Same as 3 targets, but stop using **Gnashing Fang**.

**\*Fated Circle** is unlocked at level 72, as a result, it cannot be used in **UCoB** or **UWU**. Keep this in mind for phases where you do multi-target, including Garuda, Ifrit and UCoB Adds. In this case, Burst Strike to avoid overcapping on two targets, ignore cartridges on three or more targets.*

# Level 72+

1 Target:

* Cast the **Solid Barrel** combo.
* Cast the **Gnashing Fang** combo + **Danger Zone** every 30s.
* Cast **Bow Shock** + **Sonic Break** under **No Mercy.**
* **Burst Strike** excess cartridges to avoid overcapping.

2-3 Targets:

* Cast the **Demon Slaughter** combo.
* Cast the **Gnashing Fang** combo + **Danger Zone** every 30s.
* Cast **Bow Shock** + **Sonic Break** under **No Mercy.**
* **Fated Circle** excess cartridges to avoid overcapping.

4+ Targets:

* Stop casting **Gnashing Fang**.

*Bloodfest is unlocked at level 76. Use it on cooldown and ensure you have an empty gauge when using it.*

# Level 80+

A lot of the guide’s core rules are applicable at level 80+. The only differences between level 80 to level 100 are the lack of a third Cart, no **Hypervelocity,** no **Double Down**, and no **Lionheart**, but the same rotational rules still apply. Since **Double Down** and **Lionheart** are AOE actions, you should naturally prioritize them as a part of your AOE rotation.

# Level 94+

* The **Solid Barrel** combo should now be used up to 2 targets.
* Begin using the **Demon Slaughter** combo at 3 or more targets.
