# Introduction to Gunbreaker

Gunbreaker is a more fast paced builder-spender rotation that requires good management of its cartridge gauge to make effective use of its damage buff, No Mercy.

Gunbreaker is a powerhouse that deals consistently high DPS in exchange for good usage of its gauge and cooldowns. The better you treat it, the better it will treat you.

The purpose of this guide is to introduce how to use the cartridge gauge, how to use No Mercy properly, and how to fulfill the rotational goals surrounding them including an introduction to endgame optimization.

We hope you find this guide resourceful, and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out in The Balance in either #gnb_lounge or #gnb_questions and ask us about anything.

# Rotation

The Gunbreaker rotation is a builder-spender rotation built around attempting to maximize damage inside the personal buff, No Mercy, every 60 seconds.

The **powder gauge** is used to save cartridges that can be spent on various weaponskills. At Level 30, the Powder Gauge will hold **2 cartridges** and at Level 88 it's expanded to **3 Cartidges.**
There are three ways to generate cartridges:

* The Solid Barrel combo.
* The Demon Slaughter combo.
* Bloodfest: A Level 76 oGCD action.   

The Solid Barrel combo consists of three single-target weaponskills, Keen Edge, Brutal Shell, and Solid Barrel. 
By completing one full combo, one cartridge is granted to the powder gauge.

The Demon Slaughter combo consists of two AOE weaponskills, Demon Slice, and Demon Slaughter. 
By completing one full combo, one cartridge is granted to the powder gauge.
This replaces the Solid Barrel combo at 2+ targets.

Bloodfest is an off-global cooldown that has a 120 second cooldown. 
The powder gauge is completely filled when using this action.
Do not use Bloodfest until the powder gauge is empty, or cartridges will be overwritten.

It is very important to not overcap the powder gauge. Whenever the powder gauge is full, and the next combo action will generate a cartridge, a cartridge must be spent instead first.

### Using the Powder Gauge

- - -

When cartridges have been generated, they can be spent on **four different weaponskills**:

1. Gnashing Fang.
2. Double Down.
3. Burst Strike.
4. Fated Circle.  

**Gnashing Fang** is a combo chain composed of three weaponskills costing one cartridge.

* Continuation should be cast with every action in this combo chain.
* Failing to cast Continuation on the same GCD will lose that usage.
* This should be cast once within No Mercy, and once outside of it.

**Double Down** is a powerful AOE weaponskill costing two cartridges used within No Mercy.

**Burst Strike** costs one cartridge, and will proc Continuation at level 86+.

* Burst Strike is used in No Mercy, or used to prevent overcapping the powder gauge.
* Prioritize cartridge spending on Gnashing Fang and Double Down first.

**Fated Circle** is the AOE version of Burst Strike, costing one cartridge.

- - -

To understand how to manage the gauge, break the rotation down into two phases:

* The filler phase.
* The burst phase.

The basic rotational loop is continuously transitioning from the filler phase to the burst phase. The burst phase begins when No Mercy is activated, and the filler phase begins when No Mercy ends.

### Filler Phase

- - -

The filler phase is active whenever No Mercy **is not active**. It is used to *prepare* for No Mercy.

Use the Solid Barrel or Demon Slaughter combos to generate cartridges for No Mercy.

* Do not allow the cartridge gauge to overcap. Spend a cartridge if the next action is going to overcap the cartridge gauge.

Gnashing Fang and Blasting Zone should be used off cooldown.

* Hold Gnashing Fang into No Mercy if it comes off cooldown right before No Mercy.

Once No Mercy comes off cooldown, cast it and enter the burst phase.

### Burst Phase

- - -

Cast No Mercy and all available damage cooldowns inside of it to use the 20% damage bonus.

* Do not delay No Mercy if the cartridge gauge isn’t completely full. Any buffed potency is a gain - delaying can risk usage loss.

No Mercy should contain a full Gnashing Fang combo, Double Down, Sonic Break, and as many usages of Burst Strike as possible.

* Prioritize cart spending on Gnashing Fang and Double Down over Burst Strike.
* Use combo actions when no damage cooldowns are available and the gauge is at 0 cartridges.
* If a combo action generates a cartridge; spend immediately on most optimal weaponskill available while No Mercy is active.
* Lightning Shot can be used if the boss is outside melee range.

Blasting Zone, Bow Shock, Continuation, Bloodfest, and Rough Divide are oGCD actions that should be used within No Mercy.

* Bloodfest should not be used until all cartridges have been spent.
* Bloodfest doesn’t need to be prioritized over other abilities unless a cartridge is needed for the next GCD action.
* Rough Divide may be used outside of No Mercy if additional melee uptime can be gained by gap closing to the boss. It is more optimal to use Rough Divide for its intended purpose as a gap closer to continue your uptime/avoid Lightning Shot to chase bosses than to place it under No Mercy as it is only 30 additional potency.

Once No Mercy ends, the filler phase begins again in preparation for the next burst phase.

*To help visualize these fundamental goals, there are several infographics that have been developed to assist in seeing what to do. Please review over these, and if you would like high-definition versions to download, please refer to The Balance in #gnb_resources.*



### Simple Loop Infographic

- - -

Designed to visualize the **filler phase** and **burst phase** that were previously mentioned.

The combo actions have been homogenized into one action to demonstrate that the general idea is just to build cartridges over that period of time without specifying which combo action to use.

### Gnashing Fang & Continuation Infographic

- - -

These are to demonstrate how to appropriately use both Gnashing Fang and Continuation.

Using any combo action that is not a part of the Gnashing Fang combo will cause it to break.

* Gnashing Fang will activate Continuation with every action in its combo. 
* Continuation must be used with the same GCD that activated it, or else it will be lost.

## No Mercy & Bloodfest

### No Mercy

No Mercy is the backbone of our burst. It provides a 20% damage increase for 20s.

* This duration allows us to fit nine GCDs into the buff (if not running a very slow build), ensuring the damage of those nine weaponskills is amplified. 

No Mercy should always contain the following:

\
GCD:

* Gnashing Fang*
* Double Down
* Sonic Break 
* Savage Claw 
* Wicked Talon
* Burst Strike(s)
* Remainder of your Solid Barrel combo

oGCD:

* Jugular Rip*
* Abdomen Tear 
* Eye Gouge
* Blasting Zone
* Bow Shock
* Rough Divide

As you can see, this is where GNB gets its busy reputation because of all the above abilities, in one form or another, having to be used inside a 20s window every minute. 

* As a result, you need to ensure you’re always ready for a full No Mercy Window. 
* This requires you to have three Cartridges in your Powder Gauge as Gnashing Fang requires one Cartridge and Double Down requires two Cartridges. 
* This is a fundamental rule of No Mercy and should never change. You should never be in a situation where you enter No Mercy without three Cartridges loaded.
* You ideally want two Rough Divides in every No Mercy; however you can use Rough Divide to gap close if you would otherwise lose several GCD’s due to running across the arena chasing the boss. 
* You can substitute Demon Combo and Fated Circle for Solid Barrel Combo and Burst Strike when appropriate. 

*\*At level 90, the Gnashing Fang + Jugular Rip part of your GF combo is sometimes omitted in some No Mercy windows (see Gnashing Fang ➞ No Mercy below), but before level 90, you aim to keep all of GF in every NM Window.*

**So what changes between each No Mercy Window?**\
One of the main changes is where in your Solid Barrel combo you’ll be when you enter No Mercy. As a result of this the placement of Burst Strike(s) and your combo changes but the core usage of abilities is the same.

Once you finish your Gnashing Fang Combo (Which will contain Double Down and Sonic Break), your next goal is to empty remaining carts (granted by Bloodfest), when your Power Gauge is empty, you revert back to your Solid Barrel combo. If the No Mercy buff is still present and you have generated a cart from Solid Barrel, you immediately dump the cart into Burst Strike to get it under the 20% damage up. 

The reason we begin Gnashing Fang and use Double Down followed by Sonic Break before finishing our Gnashing Fang combo is to maximize usages.

* The cooldown of an ability begins from the moment it is pressed. 
* If we wait until after Gnashing Fang combo even though it doesn’t interrupt it, then we’re just holding it for 2+ GCDs for no reason, and if downtime occurs, can cause you to heavily push Double Down or Sonic Break away from the CD of No Mercy.

**Fitting Nine GCDs:**\
A number of factors play into allowing for nine GCDs inside No Mercy: 

* Skill Speed: The time at which the No Mercy buff applies allows us just under 20 seconds to fit nine GCDs. This requires us to have a GCD recast speed that fits the ninth GCD usage while No Mercy is still active. To do this reliably and consistently, you should try to be at 2.46 or faster.
* Latency: high ping can cause a delay in your ability to immediately recast the GCD, causing “clipping” that make it difficult or impossible to get 9/9 GCDs.
* Most importantly, the time at which you hit No Mercy. The later in the GCD clock you hit No Mercy, the more you shift the buff and as such gives you more time to land the ninth GCD. This is an important piece of optimization. You ideally want to hit No Mercy roughly when a weaponskill icon looks like this:

![NoMercyClock](https://i.imgur.com/VEV9uhQ.png?1649180326 "No Mercy GCD")

&nbsp;

I also have a video where I touch on this. Although it is from Shadowbringers, it is still applicable to Endwalker. It can be seen here:** [How to Fit nine GCDs in No Mercy on GNB](https://youtu.be/rdNHJv7aLAg)**

#### Reverse Drift

Something to know about before we go any further is how Skill Speed affects your weaponskills. The more Skill Speed you have, the faster your GCD is but also the shorter the cooldown of your weaponskills. Failure to use Reverse Drift properly can result in messy No Mercy windows and ability placements so it’s worth looking into.

\
For example: at 2.41GCD (Approx 883 SKS stat) Gnashing has a CD of 29.01s, Double Down has a CD of 58.02s. However SkS does not affect abilities such as Blasting Zone, Rough Divide, No Mercy and Bloodfest. Regardless of your Skill Speed, they will retain their 30s, 60s and 120s cooldowns respectively. 

What does this mean?

If weaponskills like Gnashing Fang are used on cooldown they will eventually misalign as they are not perfect 30s or 60s and as such will come up sooner and sooner, relative to something like No Mercy. As a result we need to apply one filler GCD every 60s to keep everything lined up or else No Mercy windows will be messy and can lose optimal weaponskills inside of them.

* A filler can count as anything that is a combo action, Lightning Shot (if you are out of range), or pure downtime. (Try to avoid downtime).

#### Gnashing Fang ➞ No Mercy 

Due to the nature of how Gunbreaker is in Endwalker, if you follow the rotation as intended you will eventually come to a situation at certain intervals where you will have:

* Three Cartridges prepped.
* Solid Barrel is ready to cast at the next GCD.
* No Mercy is still on cooldown until after the next GCD. 

This isn’t an error or a mistake, it’s guaranteed in the rotation and will happen. One of the optimal choices for this is to use Gnashing Fang ➞ Jugular Rip ➞ No Mercy. 

Although we are leaving Gnashing Fang and Jugular Rip out of No Mercy, we are gaining a Burst Strike in No Mercy in its place while ensuring that No Mercy does not drift out of raid buffs by being used when it available ASAP. 

*As of update 6.11, the buff to the Gnashing Fang combo means that Gnashing+Jugular Rip are now stronger than Burst Strike + Hypervelocity. This means GF->NM is now a loss, however it still ensures no delay on No Mercy. It is difficult to give a baseline and state which is optimal (GF->NM or delaying NM to place GF inside the window) and will become a case by case basis both for kill times and openers. This is still being theorycrafted but for now you can continue with either option so long as all other rules of the class are upheld.*

## Bloodfest

Bloodfest is our second indirect/buffing offensive ability. Granting us a full Powder Gauge, it simply enables more gauge expenditure and therefore more damage. Using Bloodfest effectively is a way we can enter an optimal No Mercy without worrying about carts or can provide three Burst Strikes within No Mercy. The two biggest mistakes I see new Gunbreakers do is hold Bloodfest for No Mercy or to use it as reset for downtime; although the latter is not a bad option, it should not be used exclusively for that purpose.

With the changes to Bloodfest in update 6.2, the cooldown is now 2m, which means it'll line up with every 2nd NM after the opener. This forces us to have a hefty burst inside raid buffs now and similarly to other jobs have all of our offensive cooldowns consistently lined up with one another through out the rotation. This in turn makes Bloodfest a lot easier to manage and learn than before.

Similar to before, but now serving a singular purpose, it allows you to refill your Cartridge gauge to place three Burst Strikes into No Mercy. However with BF now also 2m, it can act as a soft reset to the job if you have died or screwed your cart gen.

Bloodfest will always grant **three** Cartridges. So using it with any carts loaded is a loss.\
1 cart loaded + 3 carts from Bloodfest = four Cartridges, **one lost due to overcap!**

## **AOE Priority**

## Final Notes

Gunbreaker doesn’t have a simple “loop”. It’s simply a shifting priority system bending around 30s and 60s burst windows. There is some static nature to the class while others are a bit fluid. Below is a flow chart that you can use to get yourself accustomed to what you should be doing when and where in the rotation. GNB has a large amount of rigidity to its rotation so bending it or trying to set up for very specific things is not something we encourage as it can have knock-on effects in your rotation.

## Defensive Breakdown

Using your defensive cooldowns properly is an important part of maximizing your effectiveness as a tank, and timing your abilities correctly will ensure you’re getting the most out of your kit while reducing your total incoming damage for the encounter. Stacking mitigation is also optimal to do, especially in high end content where the damage received is likely going to KO you without stacking your mitigation together. However, you can also stack too much which will leave you without options later, so make sure you’re pacing yourself appropriately for the encounter. 

**Weaving mitigation** is a topic a lot of people bring up. Using Mitigations such as Rampart and Camouflage can be done before your No Mercy as they have a substantial duration, and abilities such as Heart of Corundum can be weaved around a GCD such as Double Down and Sonic Break, as neither have forced oGCDs due to lacking Continuation. If you need to weave during the later part of No Mercy you can float Rough Divide, as it is the lowest-potency attack inside a No Mercy Window.

We have three self-mits that last a decent duration *but* have a lengthy cooldown.

* Rampart: Is an all around solid defensive CD due to its duration. 20% and 20s uptime, meaning it can take a tank buster and persist long enough to cover following autos if needed. Ideally you want to alternate between Rampart and Nebula when dealing with tank busters, and you rarely want to stack them as it’ll leave you with fewer options later. A more appropriate option is to stack Camouflage with Rampart, as they share the same duration and same cooldown.
* Nebula: One of your best cooldowns as it provides a better percentage reduction than Rampart, but it has a shorter duration and longer cooldown. As such, it requires some planning - you need to be aware that it will be up less, which means that using it pre-emptively will require stricter planning, and planning ahead is also going to be stricter due to the longer cooldown. While a great tool, you need to ensure you have it up when needed and to make sure you have options available when it isn’t.
* Camouflage: Very ideal for auto management due to the increased parry rate and baseline 10% damage reduction (DR). While not the best cooldown by itself for a tank buster, as the 10% is your only guaranteed mitigation and the parry may either not activate or not be even possible due to a magic tank buster, it’ll help alleviate damage intake while autos are coinciding with mechanics that your healers may be dealing with. As mentioned above, it can be stacked with Rampart to give yourself a strong combo of parry and decent DR, but keep in mind this will leave you a bit scarce after the fact if you’re tanking and taking autos.

**Heart of Corundum:** Our new tool and a great support and self management ability. Heart of Corundum is part of SE’s new sort of “Reward” system for tanks where they provide a short timed buff on top of the base buff, which if timed correctly will let you mitigate more. How Heart of Corundum works is you gain three buffs:

* Heart of Corundum: 15% DR to self or party member for 8s
* Clarity of Corundum: 15% DR to self or party member for 4s.
* Catharsis of Corundum: 900 potency heal when effect expires or when health is reduced below 50% on self or target. Buff duration 25s.
  *The effect of your Brutal Shell shield is also granted to another target, but use on yourself will not affect your own Brutal Shell shield. This is also present for Heart of Stone.

Heart of Corundum provides a 27.75%~ damage reduction for the first four seconds of its duration as the two damage reductions from Heart of Corundum and Clarity of Corundum stack together to provide a very strong opening effect which decays to 15% after four seconds. While this persists, you have Catharsis of Corundum which provides a great 900 pot heal (which can crit!). Corundum has no cost, no drawback, and a short cooldown, and is therefore an extremely powerful and versatile tool to use for support and self-sustain. However, utilizing it to its maximum potential requires you to make use of **Clarity of Corundum**. Personally, when double weaving any mitigation, I tend to weave Corundum second to ensure Clarity is present for the tank buster. That being said, keep in mind that any late mitigation will miss the damage snapshot and instead of a nice 27.75% you’ll get 0%. You ideally always want your main mitigations with Heart of Corundum for heavy hitting tank busters.

**Aurora**: A simple HoT that provides some support. Aurora is not strong enough to help heal you up from tank busters if you’re pushed into a corner nor can it alone realistically help heal you up from using Superbolide as it only ticks once every 3s, while Heart of Corundum excels at both those points. However, Aurora is a good tool to help counteract autos, DoTs and also save your healers some resources during downtime if you place it on yourself or another member. Using Aurora twice on a target does not extend the buff by 16s, it merely refreshes it to a max duration of 16s. As such, you can refresh early and waste HoT ticks.

**Superbolide**: While a bit infamous, Superbolide is actually a very very good CD when used properly. Reality is people tend to find dropping to 1HP insane, but that’s ultimately how three out of four invulns work if the damage was going to KO you. If it wasn’t? Then practically all those invulns were wasted. Superbolide can be destructive if used improperly, but when used properly and when it’s coordinated with your healers, it is very very strong. Corundum and Aurora together can help heal you back up during the 10s duration with some support from healers, and unlike Living Dead you do not require your entire pool of health to be restored, just enough to survive the oncoming damage when the buff expires. I recommend telling your healers either in party chat or in voice ahead of time when you’re going to use it so they can prepare.

**Heart of Light:** One of our two defensive raid mitigations. Heart of Light is an AOE effect that radiates from yourself and applies a buff reducing all magic damage taken by 10% for 15s. Heart of Light should be used on heavy hitting raid wides that hit the majority, if not all, of the raid. Due to the fact that it, like your personal cooldowns, is a buff with no diminishing value over the course of its duration, it excels at multiple hits over the duration and as such if used on said abilities will reduce every hit placed under the buff by 10% (Example: Stack markers in the Endwalker MSQ Extremes, J Waves, Tumults)

**Reprisal:** Similar to Heart of Light, Reprisal is an AOE centered on yourself, however it affects enemies instead of party members. As a result of this, any damage that occurs when an enemy is untargetable (for example: phase transition AOEs where you can’t attack the boss) are unable to be affected by Reprisal. Reprisal is used for assisting with similar situations to HoL due to it being a debuff over a duration, but due to the short CD, it is an option for Tank Busters as well. Make sure to coordinate Reprisal with your cotank as it is a role based ability, meaning all tanks have access to it and it does not stack so it can be overwritten.

## Dungeon Tips/Info

When running dungeons, it’s important to go at your own pace. Some tanks will want to dictate the pull speed as fast as possible by pulling wall to wall, but the reality is that you shouldn’t feel obligated to pull big if you’re not confident. If you get KO’d and wipe and reset, you’ve lost the time you would have gained by doing a big pull. Getting to the point where you can feel confident pulling big is something that you have to decide for yourself, and is simply a potential goal to keep in mind

When doing dungeons, it’s important to space your cooldowns out. You have three cooldowns that have lengthy enough durations and can be used on separate add packs. Realistically, you should only need to burn one large cooldown per pack while using your smaller cooldowns to help your sustain. Some dungeons hit harder than others, and some dungeons have larger packs to deal with, so it’s important that you are prepared to change things or use things in emergencies.

**Main Cooldown** ➞ Try spread these out over as many pulls as you can.

* Rampart
* Nebula
* Camouflage

**Small Cooldown** ➞ Use as they become available.

* Heart of Corundum 
* Aurora

**Support Cooldown** ➞ Use one per big pull to debuff all targets

* Reprisal
* Arm’s Length

**Other:**

* Superbolide can be used to let your healer take a break from doing healing to do some damage or if you’re low can buy you time for a healer to get you to 100% while you wait on other CDs to come up. However it’s very bad to use without notification. If you plan to use Bolide as a tool to gain a few seconds of immunity then let your healer know. Do not open a pull with Bolide since going from 100% to 1% defeats the purpose of the ability. Use bolide when your HP becomes low. 20% to 1% is far better than 100% to 1% because you’ve at least made some use of the 80% health that was chipped away.

The above “plan” is of course not set in stone. In an ideal world, your dungeon DPS are fast enough to kill a pack of monsters before your main cooldown wears off. However, this may not happen and you may in turn have to cycle through cooldowns or change things. There’s nothing wrong with using more than expected and taking the next few pulls slow. The reason why we use these cooldowns and do big pulls is that besides them making runs faster, you rarely need Rampart or Nebula for dungeon bosses, as their tank busters don’t hit very hard and can be taken with a well timed Heart of Corundum.

Due to Clarity of Corundum’s duration being so short, I recommend waiting a GCD or two once you have all the enemies rounded up before using Heart of Corundum. If you prepull Heart of Corundum and run in, chances are Clarity of Corundum will fall off.

## **Gearing & Skill Speeds:**

Gearing GNB, like any tank, is rather simple. Our goal when we gear up is to prioritize increasing our damage stats, as the damage reduction in our armor scales with our iLvl and as such means we don’t actually have to pick between defensive options and offensive options (which is awesome!). This means you can focus on making your gear help to make you hit as hard as you can

When melding new gear either while leveling or while grabbing new pieces while working your way towards BiS, you want to focus on the following order:

#### Skill Speed to your personal comfort > Critical Hit > Direct Hit > Determination > Tenacity

Skill Speed reduces the cooldown of weaponskills like Gnashing Fang and Double Down while also speeding up your Global Cooldown, which will make the job faster the more you stack. Everyone has their preferences on speeds and right now (as of Patch 6.05) there is nothing showing one speed is superior to the others. Speeds impact various things from getting nine GCDs in No Mercy to GCD clipping (abilities being used in conjunction so fast that they fail to immediately go off, causing a delay). 

There are positives and negatives to all builds and we absolutely recommend testing various speeds. 

* You can do so by equipping or unequipping various random pieces of gear you have lying around with Skill Speed to up/lower your SKS value and practicing on a dummy. 
* You can check your GCD by hovering over any standard weaponskill like Keen Edge.

No one can tell you what the best speed is, this is down to your preference!

#### Additional Items:

**Materia:** If you are new to endgame content then please ensure you are melding your gear with Materia. Materia is a huge contributing factor to your DPS, as it is a hefty gain in your substats. Empty Materia slots are never acceptable when doing anything higher in difficulty than dungeons. 

**Food:** Food provides a temporary (and practically mandatory) stat boost, contributing to both your total HP and your damage stats. Some builds even require food to hit your intended GCD. High quality food provide a higher gain than normal quality.

**Pots:** When doing Savage and Ultimates you’ll also want to use Pots (short for potions). These provide a limited window of a large boost in your main stat (strength for tanks) that makes your damage spike. These, when used optimally, can contribute a huge amount of DPS in a raid. Using them is something you may have to get used to and you will notice their timings marked in our openers above.\
You should always use the highest grade of High Quality Strength pot.

# Best-In-Slot

## Abyssos Savage

Below is your best-in-slot. Before you ask, there is no best of the best. If one was universally better we would only list that one set. There are trade offs and benefits for each set and it comes down to what you want to run. Keep in mind not only do gear pieces change from set to set but melds and food as well.

Use if you are a Seeker of the Sun, Midlander, and Sea Wolf:
*Why different BiS for race? - Because racial stats have a difference in strength that makes the double tome ring better for these races*\

## Ultimates

Ultimates are timeless content due to their difficulty and rewards but are forced sync and cannot be done above their release level. This affects the gear you enter the encounter with, but is more lenient as all three past Ultimates' entry IL are far below our current standard. Food and Pots do not sync, but still have a soft cap so you don’t need the absolute top current food and pots for something like UCoB as its sync is relatively low. The relic from Shadowbringers is the best choice of weapon for previous Ultimates, But will require you to get it to at least the [Augmented Law’s Order](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/3111076df9e/) stage to assign substats. [Blade’s Resolve](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/b723d663158/) gives you more substat to work with but this realistically is of only benefit in TEA, as you’ll reach cap for the substats with Law’s Order in the other two Ultimates, as such unless you want to really optimize and push as much damage as you want for TEA, you can settle for Augmented Law’s Order. If you don’t want to grind the Blade’s Resistance Relic, you can use any weapon with optimal substats that exceed the encounter’s max IL.
