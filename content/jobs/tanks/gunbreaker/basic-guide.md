# Introduction to Gunbreaker

Gunbreaker is one of the four tanks available to the player; unlocked at Lvl. 60, it provides its own unique playstyle of rewarding damage through maintaining fast-paced burst windows. In this guide we’ll cover as much as possible from the basics to the advanced stuff while answering all the FAQs, so make sure to read everything!

# Rotation

The Gunbreaker rotation is a builder-spender rotation built around attempting to maximize damage inside our personal buff, No Mercy, every 60 seconds.

* This requires us to build cartridges and spend them every minute with the objective of arriving at every No Mercy window with 3/3 cartridges.
* We must have used all of our damage cooldowns on cooldown effectively without overcapping cartridges or drifting usages.

The rotation revolves around the same one minute process of:

* Building maximum cartridges using our cart combos.
* Using Gnashing Fang.
* Using Burst Strike/Fated Circle to prevent overcapping cartridges when at 3/3 to ensure proper resource pooling.
* Using all of the highest potency damage cooldowns under No Mercy.
* Using Bloodfest on cooldown at 0 cartridges to maximize cartridge gain.

Gunbreaker starts with two cartridge slots from level 30 to level 87. 

* Upon reaching level 88, you will gain "Cartridge Charge II", granting a third cartridge.

\
All of a Gunbreaker’s offensive ability and weaponskill cooldowns are divisible by 30 seconds, meaning they will always fit into a one minute window at certain time intervals, or can simply be used every 30 seconds.

![CartGen](/img/jobs/gnb/image67.png "Cart Generation")

As detailed in the introduction to Gunbreaker’s rotation, we want to ensure we are building cartridges without overcapping for the purpose of spending as many as possible under No Mercy, and keeping Gnashing Fang on cooldown both in and outside No Mercy.

To do this, we have two options available to build cartridges:\
Solid Barrel Combo (Single Target): Builds **1 Cartridge**
Combo Actions: Keen Edge ➞ Brutal Shell ➞ Solid Barrel\
\
Demon Combo (Area of Effect): Builds **1 Cartridge**
Combo Actions: Demon Slice ➞ Demon Slaughter

This combo is utilized in 2+ Target scenarios to build 1 cartridge.

Use it to build your gauge when fighting multiple enemies. 

* It is weaker in single target scenarios than the Solid Barrel Combo, however can be used in niche circumstances such as fight specific phasings to generate more cartridges that otherwise would have been lost. Do not use this combo in single target situations outside of these special cases.

Keep in mind that in a single target environment such as raids, it takes 3 GCDs to build a cart (2 in specific cases by using Demon Slaughter), but only takes 1 to spend. As such, over spending is very destructive so you must be careful when dumping carts between Gnashing Fang and No Mercy windows.

There are **four** Weaponskills that require carts to use:

* **Gnashing Fang (1)**
* **Double Down (2)**
* **Burst strike (1)**
* **Fated Circle (1)**

**Gnashing Fang Combo (30s CD) (GCD Dependent)**

* This is a 3-weaponskill combo that includes some of your heaviest hitting weaponskills. 
  The initial weaponskill Gnashing Fang requires 1 cart to activate but the subsequent combo weaponskills Savage Claw and Wicked Talon are free. We will touch on the Gnashing combo below.

**Double Down (60s CD) (GCD Dependent)**

* Unique in that it requires **2 carts** to use and is actually one of the biggest reasons that getting as many carts as possible in your No Mercy Window is optimal, requiring all three carts ready to hit both Gnashing Fang and Double Down in quick succession.

**Burst Strike**

* Used both as a tool to prevent overcapping and to do damage inside No Mercy.

**Fated Circle**

* Has the same purpose as Burst Strike but in a 2+ Target situation.

## Gnashing Fang Combo & Continuation

Here we will discuss two things: The Gnashing Fang Combo and Continuation.
Your Gnashing Fang combo is a combo containing three high potency weaponskills that can only be used every 30s and require 1 cart to start the combo. This is pretty much your burst window’s core and is further complemented by No Mercy every 60s.
Upon using your Gnashing Fang attack you’ll begin your combo while activating Continuation:

![Continuation](/img/jobs/gnb/image60.png "Continuation")

Continuation is a follow up off-GCD hit for each of the above abilities that you use directly after each GCD. This is where Gunbreaker’s fast pace comes in, as you have these quick succession hits following your big hitters - think of every activation as a one-two punch. You will be required to get Gunbreaker to Lvl. 70 to gain these abilities.

**Gnashing Fang** will turn into **Savage Claw** and then into **Wicked Talon**, while your Continuation button will change from **Jugular Rip** to **Abdomen Tear** to **Eye Gouge.**

Upon reaching Lvl. 86 you will get Enhanced Continuation, which grants Continuation to Burst Strike, giving you access to **Hypervelocity**.

**What does a Gnashing Fang Combo look like?**
Since Gnashing Fang is **30s** and No Mercy is **60s**. Every 2nd Gnashing Fang Combo will be without No Mercy. As a result it’s not as strong but not as busy. However it still requires **1 cart** to use. Blasting Zone is also 30s so we want to keep Gnashing Fang and Blasting Zone together since they’ll both line up with No Mercy at 60s. This is a standard Gnashing Fang outside of No Mercy. We’ll take a look at the full No Mercy window further on in the guide.

![](/img/jobs/gnb/alt.png)

The order of a possible Gnashing Fang Combo is as follows:
Gnashing Fang ➞ Jugular Rip
Savage Claw ➞ Blasting Zone + Abdomen Tear
Wicked Talon ➞ Eye Gouge 

The placement of Blasting Zone can shift as it is not affected by SkS but GF combo is, as such it won’t line up in the same spot.  

One thing to keep in mind is that your Gnashing Fang is a combo but it has flexibility. 

* Certain actions can be used inside this combo (and are done so for optimal damage in buffs) without breaking it. 
* The combo can still be broken by using any of your basic combo actions (Solid Barrel or Demon Slaughter combos). 
* Breaking your Gnashing Fang is never worth it and to do so is one of the most destructive things to your DPS.

Below is an infographic on what combo flexibility looks like when using Gnashing Fang.

![ComboFlex](/img/jobs/gnb/al2.png "Combo Flexibility")

**Using any weaponskill before you use your Continuation ability gained from using Gnashing Fang Combo will cause you will lose the Continuation buff. For example:**

![ContBreak](/img/jobs/gnb/break.png "Broken Continuation")

Since Sonic Break was used **before** Jugular Rip was activated, the Continuation buff that allows you to execute Jugular Rip is lost, thus you lose a usage/damage. 
It is important to land your Continuation hits before moving onto the next GCD to avoid losing usages.
See below for a quick reference of each weaponskill and their corresponding Continuation:

* Gnashing Fang procs Jugular Rip
* Savage Claw procs Abdomen Tear 
* Wicked Talon procs Eye Gouge
* Burst Strike procs Hypervelocity

## No Mercy & Bloodfest

### No Mercy

No Mercy is the backbone of our burst. It provides a 20% damage increase for 20s.

* This duration allows us to fit 9GCDs into the buff, ensuring the damage of those 9 weaponskills is amplified. 

No Mercy will always contain the following:

\
GCD:
Gnashing Fang**\***
Double Down
Sonic Break 
Savage Claw 
Wicked Talon
Burst Strike(s)
Remainder of your Solid Barrel combo

oGCD:
Jugular Rip**\***
Abdomen Tear 
Eye Gouge
Blasting Zone
Bow Shock
Rough Divide

As you can see, this is where GNB gets its busy reputation because of all the above abilities, in one form or another, having to be used inside a 20s window every 1 minute. 

* As a result, you need to ensure you’re always ready for a full No Mercy Window. 
* This requires you to have 3 carts in your Powder Gauge as Gnashing Fang requires 1 cart and Double Down requires 2 carts. 
* This is a fundamental rule of No Mercy and should never change. You should never be in a situation where you enter No Mercy without 3 carts loaded.
* You ideally want 2xRough Divide in every No Mercy; however you can use Rough Divide to gap close if you would otherwise lose several GCD’s due to running across the arena chasing the boss. 

*\*At lvl. 90, the Gnashing Fang + Jugular Rip part of your GF combo is sometimes omitted in some No Mercy windows (see Gnashing Fang ➞ No Mercy below), but before lvl. 90, you aim to keep all of GF in every NM Window.*

**So what changes between each No Mercy Window?**\
One of the main changes is where in your Solid Barrel combo you’ll be when you enter No Mercy. As a result of this the placement of Burst Strike(s) and your combo changes but the core usage of abilities is the same.

Once you finish your Gnashing Fang Combo (Which will contain Double Down and Sonic Break), your next goal is to empty remaining carts (granted by Bloodfest), when your Power Gauge is empty, you revert back to your Solid Barrel combo. If the No Mercy buff is still present and you have generated a cart from Solid Barrel, you immediately dump the cart into Burst Strike to get it under the 20% damage up. You can see the variations below.

The father of Gunbreaker, Rin Karigani, made a chart showing an opener and the subsequent No Mercy Windows in a full uptime scenario.

You can see an example of this rotation here in Rin’s 12m rotation showcase: [Endwalker Gunbreaker Opener & 12m Rotation | No Commentary](https://youtu.be/Seua-yrZC6s)

![NM Windows](/img/jobs/gnb/gnbopener.jpg "1-2-3 No Mercy + Windows")

The Pull is the opening of the fight which is why it will contain a Tincture of Strength. If you are the Main Tank ensure you have Royal Guard on to ensure enmity. Each subsequent window is their number after the Opener. I.e 1 Minute Window is 1min after the opener, 2 Minute Window is 2m later and so on. **Please note, these windows change if you adjust your opener to something else such as Keen Mercy opener.**

As you can see, each window contains the above abilities. **The remainder of the Solid Barrel combo** is determined by what part of the combo was rolling when entering No Mercy. For example, in the 2 Minute window, you would have already used Keen Edge and Brutal Shell before using No Mercy, allowing you to end on a Solid Barrel after concluding the Gnashing Fang combo.

The reason we begin Gnashing Fang and use Double Down followed by Sonic Break before finishing our Gnashing Fang combo is to maximize usages.

* The cooldown of an ability begins from the moment it is pressed. 
* If we wait until after Gnashing Fang even though it doesn’t interrupt it, then we’re just holding it for two GCDs for no reason which can lose a usage over the course of a fight.

**Fitting 9GCDs:**\
A number of factors play into allowing for 9 GCDs inside No Mercy: 

* Skill Speed
* * The time at which the No Mercy buff applies allows us just under 20 seconds to fit 9 GCDs. This requires us to have a GCD recast speed that fits the 9th GCD usage while No Mercy is still active.
  * To do this reliably and consistently, you should try to be at 2.46 or faster.
* Latency
* * High ping can cause a delay in your ability to immediately recast the GCD, causing “clips” that make it difficult or impossible to get 9/9 GCDs.
* Most importantly, the time at which you hit No Mercy. 
* * The later in the GCD clock you hit No Mercy, the more you shift the buff and as such gives you more time to land the 9th GCD. This is an important piece of optimization. You ideally want to hit No Mercy roughly when a weaponskill icon looks like this:

![NoMercyClock](https://i.imgur.com/VEV9uhQ.png?1649180326 "No Mercy GCD")

I also have a video where I touch on this. Although it is from Shadowbringers, it is still applicable to Endwalker. It can be seen here:** [How to Fit 9GCDs in No Mercy on GNB](https://youtu.be/rdNHJv7aLAg)**

#### Reverse Drift

Something to know about before we go any further is how Skill Speed affects your weaponskills. The more Skill Speed you have, the faster your GCD is but also the shorter the cooldown of your weaponskills. Failure to use Reverse Drift properly can result in messy No Mercy windows and ability placements so it’s worth looking into.

\
For example: at 2.41GCD (Approx 883 SKS stat) Gnashing has a CD of 29.01s, Double Down has a CD of 58.02s. However SKS does not affect abilities such as No Mercy, Blasting Zone, Rough Divide and Bloodfest. Regardless of your Skill Speed, they will retain their 30s, 60s and 90s cooldowns respectively. 

What does this mean?

If weaponskills like Gnashing Fang are used on cooldown they will eventually misalign as they are not perfect 30s or 60s and as such will come up sooner and sooner, relative to something like No Mercy. As a result we need to apply one filler GCD every 60s to keep everything lined up or else No Mercy windows will be messy and can lose optimal weaponskills inside of them.

* A filler can count as anything that is a combo action, Lightning Shot (if you are out of range), or pure downtime. (Try to avoid downtime).



#### Gnashing Fang ➞ No Mercy 

Due to the nature of how Gunbreaker is in Endwalker, if you follow the rotation as intended you will eventually come to a situation at certain intervals where you will have:

* 3 cartridges prepped.
* Solid Barrel is ready to cast at the next GCD.
* No Mercy is still on cooldown until after the next GCD. 

This isn’t an error or a mistake, it’s guaranteed in the rotation and will happen. The most optimal choice for this is to use Gnashing Fang ➞ Jugular Rip ➞ No Mercy. (See 3 Minute window above). 

Although we are leaving Gnashing Fang and Jugular Rip out of No Mercy, it secures an extra Burst Strike in No Mercy while ensuring that No Mercy does not drift out of raid buffs. It has been discussed and assessed and, as odd as it is, No Mercy after Gnashing is the optimal play and is something you will need to get used to.

## Bloodfest

Bloodfest is our second indirect/buffing offensive ability. Granting us a full Powder Gauge, it simply enables more gauge expenditure and therefore more damage. Using Bloodfest effectively is a way we can enter an optimal No Mercy without worrying about carts or can provide 3xBurst Strikes within No Mercy. The two biggest mistakes I see new Gunbreakers do is hold Bloodfest for No Mercy or to use it as reset for downtime; although the latter is not a bad option, it should not be used exclusively for that purpose.

**\
Bloodfest should be used on cooldown** and, if done so, will line up for big burst windows with No Mercy naturally every 3 minutes. Delaying Bloodfest is extremely situational and should not be done excessively as it will result in lost usages. Lost usages means lost ammo, lost ammo means lost damage.

**Bloodfest is up but No Mercy is on cooldown:**\
Burst Strike or Fated Circle until your gauge is empty, then use Bloodfest to refill. 

* If Gnashing Fang is coming up, you can use Gnashing Fang to dump 1 cart unless waiting for Gnashing will cause you to hold Bloodfest for several GCDs, in that case, Burst Strike to 0 carts ➞ Bloodfest ➞ Gnashing Fang.

**Bloodfest is up and No Mercy is ready:**\
No Mercy is to be entered the same as any other window, being already at 3/3 cartridges. 

* Utilize  Gnashing Fang and  Double Down to get to 0/3 carts, then use Bloodfest to gain 3/3 cartridges again. 

This allows you to refill your cartridge gauge to place 3  Burst Strikes into No Mercy.

Bloodfest will always grant 3 carts. So using it with any carts loaded is a loss.\
1 cart loaded + 3 carts from Bloodfest = 4 carts, **1 lost due to overcap!**

## **AOE Priority**

![AOE Prio](/img/jobs/gnb/image41.png "AOE Rotation/Priority")

## Final Notes

Gunbreaker doesn’t have a simple “loop”. It’s simply a shifting priority system bending around 30s and 60s burst windows. There is some static nature to the class while others are a bit fluid. Below is a flow chart that you can use to get yourself accustomed to what you should be doing when and where in the rotation. GNB has a large amount of rigidity to its rotation so bending it or trying to set up for very specific things is not something we encourage as it can have knock-on effects in your rotation.

![](/img/jobs/gnb/flow1.png)

# Defensive Off Global Cool Down Abilities

![Aurora](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Aurora.png)

# Combos

GNB has three combos. The **Solid Barrel** combo, **Demon Slaughter** combo, and **Gnashing Fang** combo. 

![SolidBarrelCombo](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Solid_Barrel_Combo.png)

If you are unfamiliar with combo based classes in FFXIV, the game has a handy system to show you what combo skill to hit next. A dotted yellow outline will appear around the next skill in the combo. You have 15 seconds (or about 5 GCDs) to hit the next combo action before the combo deactivates (breaks). Using any other GCD ability will break combos as well, with some exceptions. 

| **Keen Edge->**                                       | **Brutal Shell->**                                          | **Solid Barrel**                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![KeenEdge](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Keen_Edge.png) | ![BrutalShell](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Brutal_Shell.png) | ![SolidBarrel](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Solid_Barrel.png) |

Solid Barrel combo is our single target combo. Builds one Cartridge.

| **Demon Slice->**                                         | **Demon Slaughter**                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![DemonSlice](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Demon_Slice.png) | ![DemonSlaughter](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Demon_Slaughter.png) |

Demon Slaughter combo is our 2+ target AoE combo. Builds one Cartridge.
We will talk about when to use Solid Barrel combo vs Demon Slaughter combo in the next section. 

![GnashingFangCombo](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Gnashing_Fang_Combo.png)

**Gnashing Fang -> Jugular Rip -> Savage Claw -> Abdomen Tear -> Wicked Talon -> Eye Gouge**

Gnashing Fang combo is our Cartridge spender combo. It does high damage and is a very important part of our burst. Note: Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, and Eye Gouge must be used after Gnashing Fang, Savage Claw, and Wicked Talon respectively or the buff that lets them be used will be lost. 

## What Does/Doesn’t Break Combos

Combos are broken when using non-combo GCDs before the combo is finished. However, there are several skills on GNB that do not interrupt combos. 

The **Gnashing Fang** combo does not interrupt any other combos. However, using any **Solid Barrel** or **Demon Slaughter** combo GCDs will interrupt the **Gnashing Fang** combo. 

**Burst Strike**, **Fated Circle**, and **Sonic Break** do not interrupt any combos. **Lightning Shot** interrupts all three of our combos. 

The following images are a visual representation of the previous paragraph, made by Rin Karigani. Please note **Keen Edge** combo and **Solid Barrel** combo are two names for the same thing. 

![WillXBreak1](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Will_X_Break_1.png)
![WillXBreak2](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Will_X_Break_2.png)

## AoE or Single Target

This section will only talk about AoE vs Single Target at level 80. If you are not yet level 80, please refer to the Leveling Guide for a breakdown of what you should be doing at each level bracket. 

For one target present, we use **Solid Barrel** combo and **Burst Strike**.
For 2+ targets: **Demon Slaughter** combo and **Fated Circle**.

Continue to use the **Gnashing Fang** combo on cooldown until there are 4+ targets. At 4+ you should ignore the **Gnashing Fang** combo and only use the **Demon Slaughter** combo and **Fated Circle**. 

Use **No Mercy** on cooldown regardless of how many targets you have. Whether or not **Sonic Break** is useful in multi-target fights will depend on how long it will be on the target as well as the number of targets. Whether or not to use it will be a case-by-case basis. At somewhere around 5+ targets, it likely will be a loss to use regardless.

## No Mercy Windows

Always try to enter **No Mercy** with two Cartridges ready when possible. At any normal skill speed, there should always be nine GCDs within the **No Mercy** buff. These buff windows should look similar to the opener and should always contain the following skills:

GCDs:

* **Sonic Break**
* **Gnashing Fang, Savage Claw, Wicked Talon**
* **2 Burst Strikes**
* **Keen Edge, Brutal Shell, and Solid Barrel**

oGCDs:

* **Blasting Zone**
* **Bow Shock**
* **2 Rough Divides**
* **Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, Eye Gouge**

When **Bloodfest** is ready inside **No Mercy**, it creates an opportunity for a stronger burst window that will occur every three minutes, allowing for three or four **Burst Strikes** instead of only two. Since we get more **Burst Strikes**, but we can only fit nine GCDs under the buff still, we have one or two fewer **Solid Barrel** combo GCDs compared to a regular **No Mercy** window. This means the following skills are in No Mercy when **Bloodfest** is ready:

GCDs:
Sonic Break

* **Gnashing Fang, Savage Claw, Wicked Talon**
* **Two** **Solid Barrel** combo GCDs and three **Burst Strikes** OR
* One **Solid Barrel** combo GCDs and four **Burst Strikes**

oGCDs:

* **Blasting Zone**
* **Bow Shock**
* **Two Rough Divides**
* **Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, Eye Gouge**
* **Bloodfest**

Getting four **Burst Strikes** in **No Mercy** is only possible if **No Mercy** is ready after **Brutal Shell**, and you already have two Cartridges ready to go. Do not hold **No Mercy** until after **Brutal Shell** to force a four **Burst Strike** **No Mercy** window! Doing so will cause you to misalign from raid buffs, which over time will be a much bigger loss than the gain of getting four **Burst Strikes** instead of three. 

If you are unable to fit nine GCDs in **No Mercy**, make sure that you are pressing **No Mercy** at approximately ⅔’s of the way into the GCD clock as shown here:

## Bloodfest

**Bloodfest** should not be held for the next **No Mercy** window. Because it has a cooldown of 90s and **No Mercy** has a cooldown of 60s, **Bloodfest** will naturally be inside **No Mercy** every three minutes. As **Bloodfest**’s cooldown is getting close to finishing, spend Cartridges to avoid delaying **Bloodfest** or overcapping on Cartridges. 

## Cartridge Usage

Cartridges should generally not be used outside of **No Mercy** unless they are being used for **Gnashing Fang**, if you would otherwise overcap on Cartridges, or fight specific optimizations such as hitting multiple targets with **Fated Circle**. Doing this helps to ensure that **No Mercy** is entered with two Cartridges ready. 

# Openers

Openers are designed to do a few very important things:

1. Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost uses.
2. Get strong abilities under raid buffs. This helps to maximize damage done. More damage is always better, especially when it's free!
3. Set up our rotation for the rest of the fight (or until a transition/extended period of downtime). This is especially important for fight specific optimizations and using the right opener may gain a use of important abilities like the **Gnashing Fang** combo.

The theoretical standard opener for a full-uptime encounter is the 4th GCD **No Mercy** opener: (Graphic by Rin Karigani)![4thGcdNoMercy](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/4th_Gcd_No_Mercy.png)

At higher levels of gameplay, you can and should adjust your opener based on your group composition and the specifics of the fight. 

Because openers will change tier-to-tier and fight-to-fight, please refer to the #gnb_resources channel in The Balance for the most up-to-date openers.

# Rotation

## Priority System

Previous GNB guides have thought of the rotation in terms of a 60s/three minute loop. In practice, the GNB rotation is much less a loop and more of a priority system. GNB is more accurately an “if X is ready, do X, else do Y” class. Therefore, after the opener the rotation priority is as follows (with one caveat, mentioned following the priority list):

1. Use **No Mercy** on cooldown.
2. Use **Gnashing Fang**, **Sonic Break**, **Blasting Zone**, **Bow Shock**, **Bloodfest** on cooldown. 
3. Spend all Cartridges inside **No Mercy** where possible. 
4. Use **Rough Divide** twice inside **No Mercy** (unless a use is needed for uptime)
5. Outside of **No Mercy**, only spend Cartridges on **Gnashing Fang** or if you would otherwise overcap on Cartridges.
6. Use **Solid Barrel** combo on 1 target, **Demon Slaughter** combo on 2+ targets if nothing higher on the priority is available. 

* Since **Gnashing Fang** and **Sonic Break** have their cooldown reduced by skill speed, we need to delay them by one GCD every minute by adding a filler GCD. Otherwise they will end up being before No Mercy which is a significant loss. 

Because GNB is more of a priority system than a strict rotation, the rotation is very flexible and can be adjusted to the needs of the encounter and group composition.

## GCD Uptime

GCD uptime refers to pressing your weapon skills (GCDs) as soon as they are available. If there are spaces between when your GCD is ready and when you press the next one, you will lose a significant amount of damage. As such, we aim to keep our GCDs rolling as much as possible. Please note, this only refers to when an enemy is present. It is possible to achieve a minimum of 96% uptime in every fight. Anything lower than that is almost guaranteed to be caused by not playing correctly. How to increase this number around mechanics that normally seem like they should cause downtime is a fight specific optimization and will vary fight to fight. Even if you are making mistakes, it is almost always better to keep your GCD rolling than to just not do anything. 

A big part of GCD uptime for GNB comes from being able to move bosses during heavy burst windows. Since the **Gnashing Fang** combo must be followed by **Continuation**, which is a melee range skill, it can make moving the boss during this window frustrating. Some common ways to alleviate this frustration are:

1. Sprint! The faster you move, the faster the boss moves to you. Just be careful not to go too fast so you don’t rip the boss out of the range of melee dps. 
2. Take advantage of the ability to use **Burst Strike** between **Gnashing** combo GCDs. This will give you an extra GCD with no required weaves to move faster. 
3. Press the GCD, move out, then move back in before the next GCD is ready so you have enough time to use **Continuation** without delaying the next GCD. There are two ways to do this. For example, you could:

**Gnashing Fang**, run out, run back in, **Jugular Rip**, **Savage Claw**, run out, run back in, **Abdomen Tear**, **Wicked Talon**, run out, run back in, **Eye Gouge**, etc. 
Or
**Gnashing Fang**, **Jugular Rip**, run out, run back in, **Savage Claw**, **Abdomen Tear**, run out, run back in, **Wicked Talon**, **Eye Gouge**, run out, run back in, etc.

How you approach this will largely be personal preference as well as fight specific optimization. Do what gets the best results for you. You should also ask your co-tank if they can handle moving the boss if it makes it easier on you, and doesn’t make it harder on everyone else!

# Stat Priorities

While leveling, or while trying to get to the item level cap, always prioritize item level over stats, regardless of what those stats are \[note, Normal Quality white items break this rule as they are exceptionally bad 99.999% of the time. Other than that, this model holds true]. There is a very common misconception that Tenacity should be avoided at all costs, but this is incorrect. It is not a useless stat, it is just less efficient at increasing damage than other stats are, which is why we will almost never meld Tenacity. 

## Preferred Skill Speed

GNB is very flexible and as such can make use of a variety of skill speeds with relative ease. Typically, GNB prefers speeds between 2.40 and 2.43. 2.40 in the past was viewed as a sort of baseline for the optimal speed, but in practice this doesn’t hold true unless there are fight-specific reasons to favor 2.40 over any of the other speeds. 

Preferred speed will depend mainly on fight alignment/transitions and your ping, as well as gearing options available. Higher ping players will prefer slower speeds because there is more time to be able to double weave between GCDs. Faster speeds are only typically preferred if they gain meaningful GCDs in a fight, or if gearing options mean that a faster speed is just going to have better damage overall. 

## Meld Priorities

Our basic priority system for materia melding is Critical Hit, then Skill Speed (to preferred tier only), then Direct Hit. We may use a different meld here and there that breaks the mold of this priority system, but it is very rare and will likely only be one meld, such as a Determination meld instead of a Direct hit meld due to stat tiering.
