Gunbreaker (GNB) is the 4th tank added to Final Fantasy XIV in the Shadowbringers expansion. It features high damage output and high casts-per-minute. GNB also features a strong defensive kit that, when used properly, can bring a lot of mitigation to the table. Let’s get started with a brief overview of the skills and abilities available to GNB.

# Combos

GNB has 3 combos. The **Solid Barrel** combo, **Demon Slaughter** combo, and **Gnashing Fang** combo. 

![SolidBarrelCombo](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Solid_Barrel_Combo.png)

If you are unfamiliar with combo based classes in FFXIV, the game has a handy system to show you what combo skill to hit next. A dotted yellow outline will appear around the next skill in the combo. You have 15 seconds (or about 5 GCDs) to hit the next combo action before the combo deactivates (breaks). Using any other GCD ability will break combos as well, with some exceptions. 


![KeenEdge](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Keen_Edge.png)![BrutalShell](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Brutal_Shell.png)![SolidBarrel](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Solid_Barrel.png)

**Keen Edge -> Brutal Shell -> Solid Barrel**

Solid Barrel combo is our single target combo. Builds 1 Cartridge.


![DemonSlice](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Demon_Slice.png)![DemonSlaughter](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Demon_Slaughter.png)

**Demon Slice -> Demon Slaughter**

Demon Slaughter combo is our 2+ target AoE combo. Builds 1 Cartridge.
We will talk about when to use Solid Barrel combo vs Demon Slaughter combo in the next section. 

![GnashingFangCombo](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Gnashing_Fang_Combo.png)

**Gnashing Fang -> Jugular Rip -> Savage Claw -> Abdomen Tear -> Wicked Talon -> Eye Gouge**

Gnashing Fang combo is our Cartridge spender combo. It does high damage and is a very important part of our burst. Note: Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, and Eye Gouge must be used after Gnashing Fang, Savage Claw, and Wicked Talon respectively or the buff that lets them be used will be lost. 
## What Does/Doesn’t Break Combos

Combos are broken when using non-combo GCDs before the combo is finished. However, there are several skills on GNB that do not interrupt combos. 

The **Gnashing Fang** combo does not interrupt any other combos. However, using any **Solid Barrel** or **Demon Slaughter** combo GCDs will interrupt the **Gnashing Fang** combo. 

**Burst Strike**, **Fated Circle**, and **Sonic Break** do not interrupt any combos. **Lightning Shot** interrupts all three of our combos. 

The following images are a visual representation of the previous paragraph, made by Rin Karigani. Please note **Keen Edge** combo and **Solid Barrel** combo are two names for the same thing. 

![WillXBreak1](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Will_X_Break_1.png)
![WillXBreak2](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Will_X_Break_2.png)

## AoE or Single Target

This section will only talk about AoE vs Single Target at level 80. If you are not yet level 80, use the faq command “!faq gnblvl” in #bot_spam for a breakdown of what you should do at each level bracket. 

For 1 target present, we use **Solid Barrel** combo and **Burst Strike**.
For 2+ targets: **Demon Slaughter** combo and **Fated Circle**.

Continue to use the **Gnashing Fang** combo on cooldown until there are 4+ targets. At 4+ you should ignore the **Gnashing Fang** combo and only use the **Demon Slaughter** combo and **Fated Circle**. 

Use **No Mercy** on cooldown regardless of how many targets you have. Whether or not **Sonic Break** is useful in multi-target fights will depend on how long it will be on the target as well as the number of targets. Whether or not to use it will be a case-by-case basis. At somewhere around 5+ targets, it likely will be a loss to use regardless.

## No Mercy Windows
Always try to enter **No Mercy** with 2 Cartridges ready when possible. At any normal skill speed, there should always be 9 GCDs within the **No Mercy** buff. These buff windows should look similar to the opener and should always contain the following skills:


GCDs:
- **Sonic Break**
- **Gnashing Fang, Savage Claw, Wicked Talon**
- **2 Burst Strikes**
- **Keen Edge, Brutal Shell, and Solid Barrel**


oGCDs:
- **Blasting Zone**
- **Bow Shock**
- **2 Rough Divides**
- **Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, Eye Gouge**

When **Bloodfest** is ready inside **No Mercy**, it creates an opportunity for a stronger burst window that will occur every 3 minutes, allowing for 3 or 4 **Burst Strikes** instead of only 2. Since we get more **Burst Strikes**, but we can only fit 9 GCDs under the buff still, we have 1 or 2 fewer **Solid Barrel** combo GCDs compared to a regular **No Mercy** window. This means the following skills are in No Mercy when **Bloodfest** is ready:

GCDs:
Sonic Break
- **Gnashing Fang, Savage Claw, Wicked Talon**
- 2 **Solid Barrel** combo GCDs and 3 **Burst Strikes** OR
- 1 **Solid Barrel** combo GCDs and 4 **Burst Strikes**

oGCDs:
- **Blasting Zone**
- **Bow Shock**
- **2 Rough Divides**
- **Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, Eye Gouge**
- **Bloodfest**

Getting 4 **Burst Strikes** in **No Mercy** is only possible if **No Mercy** is ready after **Brutal Shell**, and you already have 2 Cartridges ready to go. Do not hold **No Mercy** until after **Brutal Shell** to force a 4 **Burst Strike** **No Mercy** window! Doing so will cause you to misalign from raid buffs, which over time will be a much bigger loss than the gain of getting 4 **Burst Strikes** instead of 3. 

If you are unable to fit 9 GCDs in **No Mercy**, make sure that you are pressing **No Mercy** at approximately ⅔’s of the way into the GCD clock as shown here:

![SolidBarrelCombo](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Solid_Barrel_Combo.png)

## Bloodfest
**Bloodfest** should not be held for the next **No Mercy** window. Because it has a cooldown of 90s and **No Mercy** has a cooldown of 60s, **Bloodfest** will naturally be inside **No Mercy** every 3 minutes. As **Bloodfest**’s cooldown is getting close to finishing, spend Cartridges to avoid delaying **Bloodfest** or overcapping on Cartridges. 

## Cartridge Usage
Cartridges should generally not be used outside of **No Mercy** unless they are being used for **Gnashing Fang**, if you would otherwise overcap on Cartridges, or fight specific optimizations such as hitting multiple targets with **Fated Circle**. Doing this helps to ensure that **No Mercy** is entered with 2 Cartridges ready. 

# Openers
Openers are designed to do a few very important things:
1. Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost uses.
2. Get strong abilities under raid buffs. This helps to maximize damage done. More damage is always better, especially when it's free!
3. Set up our rotation for the rest of the fight (or until a transition/extended period of downtime). This is especially important for fight specific optimizations and using the right opener may gain a use of important abilities like the **Gnashing Fang** combo.

The theoretical standard opener for a full-uptime encounter is the 4th GCD **No Mercy** opener: (Graphic by Rin Karigani)![4thGcdNoMercy](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/4th_Gcd_No_Mercy.png)

At higher levels of gameplay, you can and should adjust your opener based on your group composition and the specifics of the fight. 

Because openers will change tier-to-tier and fight-to-fight, please refer to the #gnb_resources channel in The Balance for the most up-to-date openers.

# Rotation

## Priority System
Previous GNB guides have thought of the rotation in terms of a 60s/3minute loop. In practice, the GNB rotation is much less a loop and more of a priority system. GNB is more accurately an “if X is ready, do X, else do Y” class. Therefore, after the opener the rotation priority is as follows (with one caveat, mentioned following the priority list):

1. Use **No Mercy** on cooldown.
2. Use **Gnashing Fang**, **Sonic Break**, **Blasting Zone**, **Bow Shock**, **Bloodfest** on cooldown. 
3. Spend all Cartridges inside **No Mercy** where possible. 
4. Use **Rough Divide** twice inside **No Mercy** (unless a use is needed for uptime)
5. Outside of **No Mercy**, only spend Cartridges on **Gnashing Fang** or if you would otherwise overcap on Cartridges.
6. Use **Solid Barrel** combo on 1 target, **Demon Slaughter** combo on 2+ targets if nothing higher on the priority is available. 

- Since **Gnashing Fang** and **Sonic Break** have their cooldown reduced by skill speed, we need to delay them by 1 GCD every minute by adding a filler GCD. Otherwise they will end up being before No Mercy which is a significant loss. 

Because GNB is more of a priority system than a strict rotation, the rotation is very flexible and can be adjusted to the needs of the encounter and group composition.

## GCD Uptime
GCD uptime refers to pressing your weapon skills (GCDs) as soon as they are available. If there are spaces between when your GCD is ready and when you press the next one, you will lose a significant amount of damage. As such, we aim to keep our GCDs rolling as much as possible. Please note, this only refers to when an enemy is present. It is possible to achieve a minimum of 96% uptime in every fight. Anything lower than that is almost guaranteed to be caused by not playing correctly. How to increase this number around mechanics that normally seem like they should cause downtime is a fight specific optimization and will vary fight to fight. Even if you are making mistakes, it is almost always better to keep your GCD rolling than to just not do anything. 

A big part of GCD uptime for GNB comes from being able to move bosses during heavy burst windows. Since the **Gnashing Fang** combo must be followed by **Continuation**, which is a melee range skill, it can make moving the boss during this window frustrating. Some common ways to alleviate this frustration are:

1. Sprint! The faster you move, the faster the boss moves to you. Just be careful not to go too fast so you don’t rip the boss out of the range of melee dps. 
2. Take advantage of the ability to use **Burst Strike** between **Gnashing** combo GCDs. This will give you an extra GCD with no required weaves to move faster. 
3. Press the GCD, move out, then move back in before the next GCD is ready so you have enough time to use **Continuation** without delaying the next GCD. There are two ways to do this. For example, you could:

**Gnashing Fang**, run out, run back in, **Jugular Rip**, **Savage Claw**, run out, run back in, **Abdomen Tear**, **Wicked Talon**, run out, run back in, **Eye Gouge**, etc. 
Or
**Gnashing Fang**, **Jugular Rip**, run out, run back in, **Savage Claw**, **Abdomen Tear**, run out, run back in, **Wicked Talon**, **Eye Gouge**, run out, run back in, etc.

How you approach this will largely be personal preference as well as fight specific optimization. Do what gets the best results for you. You should also ask your co-tank if they can handle moving the boss if it makes it easier on you, and doesn’t make it harder on everyone else!

# Stat Priorities
While leveling, or while trying to get to the item level cap, always prioritize item level over stats, regardless of what those stats are [note, Normal Quality white items break this rule as they are exceptionally bad 99.999% of the time. Other than that, this model holds true]. There is a very common misconception that Tenacity should be avoided at all costs, but this is incorrect. It is not a useless stat, it is just less efficient at increasing damage than other stats are, which is why we will almost never meld Tenacity. 

## Preferred Skill Speed
GNB is very flexible and as such can make use of a variety of skill speeds with relative ease. Typically, GNB prefers speeds between 2.40 and 2.43. 2.40 in the past was viewed as a sort of baseline for the optimal speed, but in practice this doesn’t hold true unless there are fight-specific reasons to favor 2.40 over any of the other speeds. 

Preferred speed will depend mainly on fight alignment/transitions and your ping, as well as gearing options available. Higher ping players will prefer slower speeds because there is more time to be able to double weave between GCDs. Faster speeds are only typically preferred if they gain meaningful GCDs in a fight, or if gearing options mean that a faster speed is just going to have better damage overall. 

## Meld Priorities
Our basic priority system for materia melding is Critical Hit, then Skill Speed (to preferred tier only), then Direct Hit. We may use a different meld here and there that breaks the mold of this priority system, but it is very rare and will likely only be one meld, such as a Determination meld instead of a Direct hit meld due to stat tiering.

# What’s Next After The Basics?
## Raid Buffs

![ChainStratagem](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Chain_Stratagem.png)
Chain Stratagem (Scholar)

Increases Critical Hit rate against the affected target by 10% for 15s. 120s cooldown.


![Divination](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Divination.png)
Divination (Astrologian)

Increases damage dealt by 4, 5, or 6% (determined by how many different seals the AST has before using Divination) for 15s. 120s cooldown.


![TechnicalFinish](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Technical_Finish.png)
Technical Finish (Dancer)

Increases damage dealt by 5% for 20s. 120s cooldown.


![TrickAttack](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Trick_Attack.png)
Trick Attack (Ninja)

Increases damage dealt against the affected target by 5% for 15s. 60s cooldown.


![Embolden](/img/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/Embolden.png)
Embolden (Red Mage)

Increases physical damage dealt by 10/8/6/4/2% for 20s. Starts at 10% and decreases by 2% every 4s. 120s cooldown.


GNB has a damage toolkit that is very well suited for aligning with most raid buffs. With a 1 minute burst cycle, our **No Mercy** window should fit cleanly into every use of every non-**Brotherhood** raid buff, assuming that buffs aren’t being drifted due to player error or downtime/phase transitions. 

Because our toolkit is extremely flexible, we should change the order of our skills based on what buff composition we have. For example, if Red Mage is present, we try to put **Sonic Break**, **Blasting Zone**, and **Bow Shock** under the maximum **Embolden**. Because raid buffs interact multiplicatively and not additively, we also try to get our strongest abilities under the maximum number of raid buffs active at the same time, and should carefully consider how to fit our biggest potency skills into the most raid buffs. 

Because **Brotherhood** is on a 90s cycle, only every other one will align with our **No Mercy** windows. However, we should still aim to use the **Gnashing Fang** combo, **Blasting Zone**, and **Burst Strike** under **Brotherhood**. Since **Brotherhood** and **Bloodfest** are the same cooldown, we can use **Bloodfest** to get 2 **Burst Strikes** in **Brotherhood**, while still having 2 Cartridges ready for the next **No Mercy** window. 

With this said, we do not hold our abilities for long amounts of time to compensate for a player not using their raid buff on time. This can cause us to misalign from the rest of the raid buffs, or cause us to lose uses of our skills. Some fights require us to think critically about whether or not we use skills outside of raid buffs in order to get more uses or DoT ticks. In general, more uses or DoT ticks are worth more than getting something under raid buffs, but this is going to be a fight-specific optimization to look at and will depend strongly on what raid buffs your group has.

## Maximizing Skill Uses
We should always aim to get the maximum number of uses of our skills as possible. Missing a use of an oGCD skill is a direct potency loss. For example, if you do not hit Blasting Zone as close to on cooldown as possible, and it causes you to miss a final use before a transition or before the target dies, you have directly lost 800 potency at minimum (more if it cost a use of it under No Mercy). Maximizing skill uses should come as a natural part of fight optimization, determining which opener to use, as well as how to handle downtime (i.e. hold XYZ for after or try to squeeze it in before). 

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Q: What food and potions should I be using on GNB?
A: Highest level strength potions available. Always use HQ. Food will vary from tier to tier based on what foods are available, but usually it will be Crit/Det food or Crit/Skill Speed food.

Q: Should I be using X opener if Main Tanking (called Primary Tank in some regions)??
A: Being Main or Off Tank (Primary or Secondary Tank) does not affect what opener you use. You will almost always be using the standard raid buff opener [see #gnb_resources] unless there is a fight specific opener for a fight. 

Q: **Gnashing Fang** is ready earlier and earlier before **No Mercy**, why is this happening?
A: See this [section](#priority-system). 

Q: Do I hold Bloodfest for No Mercy?
A: See this [section](#bloodfest).
