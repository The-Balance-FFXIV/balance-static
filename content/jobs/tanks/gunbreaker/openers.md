# Openers

Your opener is flexible and **No Mercy** can be used earlier or later than what is listed in either of these openers if necessary to allow for additional uses to be used before phases or mechanics, or alignment to your party's buffs.

#### PULLING TECHNIQUES

* **Lightning Shot** is heavily suggested for raid buff alignment and pull consistency.
* You may opt to use **Trajectory** at -0.22s on the pull timer for an accurate pull at 0.00s.
* You may opt to use **Provoke** at -0.6s on the pull timer for an accurate pull at 0.00s. Exercise caution using this method - you may need this cooldown if the fight begins with a tankbuster.
* Do not facepull unless the boss is already within melee range. It is a waste of GCD uptime in comparison to the other two options.
