# Openers

Your opener is flexible and **No Mercy** can be used earlier than what is listed in either of these openers if necessary to allow for additional uses to be used before phases or mechanics.

The **Lightning Shot** is not required in these, but is **heavily suggested** for engagement timing. Facepulling is not consistent unless you can pull from within melee range without beginning the encounter.

### Standard Opener (**â‰¤** 2.47 GCD)

### 2.50 Opener

This opener may also be used by other speeds, but is specifically suggested for 2.50 for the sake of long-term buff alignment.
