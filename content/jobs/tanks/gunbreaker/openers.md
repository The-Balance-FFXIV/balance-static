# Openers

Your opener is flexible and **No Mercy** can be used earlier or later than what is listed in either of these openers if necessary to allow for additional uses to be used before phases or mechanics, or alignment to your party's buffs.

#### PULLING TECHNIQUES

* Do not facepull unless the boss is already within melee range. It is a waste of GCD uptime in comparison to the following options:
  * **Lightning Shot** is heavily suggested for MT threat generation and buff alignment.
  * You may opt to use **Trajectory** at -0.66s on the pull timer for an accurate pull at 0.00s, however it is only worth 20% of the enmity of **Lightning Shot** and may lose aggro briefly on pull until the first GCD lands (~0.9s after pull begins).
  * You may opt to use **Provoke** at -0.6s on the pull timer for an accurate pull at 0.00s. Exercise caution using this method - you may need **Provoke** if the fight begins with a tankbuster.
