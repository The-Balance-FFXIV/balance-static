  - question: How do I optimally spend MP?
    answer: >
      Over the course of a fight, you should generally only use **Edge of
      Shadow** in these three situations:

      - You're about to overcap MP

      - You're about to run out of Darkside

      - You're in burst, and have damage-increasing buffs


      You should also aim to use **The Blackest Night** before buffs to get a charge of Dark Arts. This can be on auto-attacks, tankbusters, a raidwide, or anything you can. Dark Arts will allow you to get an additional **Edge of Shadow** in buffs.


      You should liberally use **The Blackest Night** to avoid damage as needed, too. It is always better to move damage out of buffs in order to stay alive.
  - question: Can I use all my MP on The Blackest Night (TBN)?
    answer: Up to 3 (4 with careful timing) MP spenders per 2 minutes can be **TBN**
      without moving damage out of party buff windows. However, it is always
      better to move damage out of party buffs in order to stay alive, or to
      save healer GCDs --- don't worry about 'losing damage', especially when
      progressing a fight.
  - question: Why don't we use Living Shadow prepull/Should I use Living Shadow
      during phase transitions?
    answer: Using **Living Shadow** prepull can result in some of its damage coming
      out before raid buffs. For some phase transitions, you may nevertheless
      find it useful to use Living Shadow early (up to 6.8s before the enemy
      becomes targetable), either because buffs are being used immediately when
      the enemy returns, or because a tight phase timing means that you would
      lose a usage of Living Shadow by delaying it.
  - question: Why don't we use Delirium earlier/prepull?
    answer: Using **Delirium** prepull leads to MP being generated too early,
      forcing an **Edge of Shadow** outside of buffs (at the 2 minute and
      subsequent buff windows). Some fight circumstances may lead to this still
      being worthwhile, but in general, the later placement of **Delirium** is
      better.
  - question: " Why are the oGCDs in the opener ordered the way that they are?"
    answer: The opener is laid out to avoid overcapping on MP both in the opener and
      in future party buff windows, and secondarily to maximize the damage you
      do if the fight ends in the middle of a party buff window.
  - question: What GCD speed(s) should I use?
    answer: >-
      It's personal preference. They sim extremely similarly, but they 'feel'
      slightly different. The main differences in 'feel' are:

      - 2.50: Nothing will clip, and all oGCDs will align perfectly if you keep your GCD rolling. Bursts will have variable amounts of starting Blood.

      - 2.46: Carve and Spit will drift slightly to prevent clipping your GCD, but Blood is more consistent, and each burst will have 70 Blood going into it in full uptime.


      If in doubt, or if none of that made sense, we recommend 2.50. It will likely be more forgiving if you're new to the job or have very high ping, as well as simming very slightly better. If you like Dark Knight a lot, then we recommend trying both, and deciding for yourself what's comfiest for you.
  - question: What food should I use?
    answer: "Caramel Popcorn (high quality) is the best food for all of our
      recommended gearsets, and will be very likely best for any other set of
      gear, too. "
  - question: How much mitigation will I gain/damage will I lose by focusing on Tenacity?
    answer: >-
      Every 24-25 points of Tenacity give 0.1% additional damage, and every
      13-14 points give 0.1% additional mitigation. For comparison, every 19-20
      points of Determination give 0.1% additional damage (and no mitigation).

      For 7.00 best gear, a full focus on Tenacity gains approximately 6.2% mitigation and loses approximately 0.8% damage compared to the best damage melds.
  - question: How does Shadowed Vigil's heal interact with heal-increasing effects,
      like Rampart?
    answer: "**Vigilant**, the buff that provides the delayed heal, will be buffed
      if the heal-increasing effect is present upon buff **application**, or in
      other words, shortly after you press **Shadowed Vigil**. Applying
      heal-increasing effects like **Rampart** after you already have
      **Vigilant** will not increase its healing."

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon (or Delirium)?

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon. It is possible to mitigate some latency by using a gaming VPN (for example, Mudfish or PingZapper).

# I’m disengaging from the boss, should I use Unmend?

Generally no. Breaking a combo by using Unmend in the middle of it is a bigger loss than waiting to get back to the boss. You can safely Unmend if you are leaving the boss for long enough that your combo would drop anyway (15s or roughly six GCDs), or if you are between combos and disengaging for at least one full GCD.

# Should I hold Blood Weapon for Delirium? Should I hold Delirium for Blood Weapon?

No. There is no inherent synergy between Blood Weapon and Delirium—Blood Weapon will always give 3000 MP and 50 Blood, regardless of if you use Delirium at the same time. Unless you know your kill-time and that holding one or the other will not lose a usage, do not hold either Blood Weapon or Delirium.
