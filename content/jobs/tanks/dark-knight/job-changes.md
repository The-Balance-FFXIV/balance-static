changes:
  - patch: "7.0"
    description: View the latest changes at the Official Site, located
      [here](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/darkknight/)!
  - patch: "7.05"
    description: DRK received minor buffs to its main combo potency, to Carve and
      Spit, and to Disesteem.
  - patch: "7.1"
    description: DRK received minor buffs to Bloodspiller potency, Delirium combo
      potencies. A 500 potency cure effect was added to Carve and Spit, and
      Abyssal Drain's cure effect was increased to 500 potency. Dark Mind now
      additionally provides 10% physical mitigation. Dark Missionary is now
      available at level 66 and additionally provides 5% physical mitigation.
      Living Dead's buff now applies immediately.
  - patch: "7.2"
    description: DRK had some of its AoE potency shifted around. Most
      cooldown-restricted AoE got a buff, while Impalement got a slight nerf. On
      the whole, this is a gain of 2.5-5.4% sustained AoE damage, depending on
      the number of targets. 2 targets have a particularly large increase, going
      down again for 3-4 targets, and then increasing with more targets up to a
      max of 5.4% at 16 targets (the most that can be hit simultaneously with
      one ability).
  - patch: "7.4"
    description: >
      Living Shadow had its duration extended by two seconds to 22 seconds. This
      functionally changes nothing (damage or otherwise) under normal
      conditions, there's just some extra time for Esteem to finish its rotation
      in case of interruptions (such as retargeting).
