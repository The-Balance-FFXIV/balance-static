    description: View the latest changes at the Official Site, located
      [here](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/darkknight/)!
  - patch: "7.05"
    description: DRK received minor buffs to its main combo potency, to Carve and
      Spit, and to Disesteem.
  - patch: "7.1"
    description: DRK received minor buffs to Bloodspiller potency, Delirium combo
      potencies. A 500 potency cure effect was added to Carve and Spit, and
      Abyssal Drain's cure effect was increased to 500 potency. Dark Mind now
      additionally provides 10% physical mitigation. Dark Missionary is now
      available at level 66 and additionally provides 5% physical mitigation.
      Living Dead's buff now applies immediately.
  - patch: "7.2"
    description: DRK had some of its AoE potency shifted around. Most
      cooldown-restricted AoE got a buff, while Impalement got a slight nerf. On
      the whole, this is a gain of 2.5-5.4% sustained AoE damage, depending on
      the number of targets. 2 targets have a particularly large increase, going
      down again for 3-4 targets, and then increasing with more targets up to a
      max of 5.4% at 16 targets (the most that can be hit simultaneously with
      one ability)
