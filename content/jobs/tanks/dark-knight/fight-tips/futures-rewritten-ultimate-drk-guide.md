# Introduction

This guide contains suggestions on how to use your cooldowns effectively, and tips and tricks to play each phase as effectively as possible.

Both 2.50 and 2.46 GCD speeds are comfortable during this fight, so we recommend choosing whatever speed you find most comfortable.

# Phase 1: Fatebreaker

Use a standard opener for this fight. 2.50 GCD with an Unmend pull is very tight on the last GCD in first uptime phase, but it is possible if the pull isn't early. You can adjust Salted Earth to be earlier in the opener to gain a use before the Diamond Dust downtime in phase 2.

Powder Mark hits much harder on the first hit than the second. Rampart can last through both hits, but Shadowed Vigil cannot. Use Rampart on the first regardless of whether you're main tank (MT) or off tank (OT), and add Dark Mind + 2x Oblation after the boss starts his quote and use The Blackest Night (TBN) as you go to your spread spot.

Pre-cast Delirium near the end of Utopian Sky. There are three indicators for this: the end of the Burnt Strike castbar, the start of the "B" in the Brightfire cast, or when debuffs hit 9 seconds.

Dark Missionary can cover 2-3 hits of Fall of Faith plus the following Burnished Glory. The earliest you can use it is as the first tether resolves, though it's recommended to err on the side of caution, as Burnished Glory is by far the most important cast to cover. Reprisal does not work on the Fall of Faith tethers that don't originate from Fatebreaker himself.

Shadowed Vigil can be used during the Burnished Glory cast before the second Power Mark. Living Dead, Dark Mind, and Oblation can be used after it finishes. Use Rampart during the cast to keep it through the second hit.

You can get a GCD as the last fire/lightning cleave goes off, but it is extremely risky with lightning at a 2.50 GCD speed. Disesteem can be held for GCD uptime there.

The minimum amount of mana you need to spend is 2 Edge of Shadows after downtime, 1 TBN on Burnished/Powder Mark, spend Dark Arts proc, then TBN again for second Powder Mark hit. You can also carry Carve and Spit and 1 Shadowbringer charge into Phase 2.

# Phase 2: Usurper of Frost

Oblation can last through both hits of Quadruple Slap with no special timing and TBN is usually better for the second hit, but most players will choose to invuln it instead. If the other tank is invulning Quadruple Slap, it's recommended that you Provoke after the second hit to save the healers from having to Esuna the vulnerability from the tank invulning the full tankbuster.

If you have Delirium before Diamond Dust, use it or lose it. This will only happen with a slow phase 1 kill. You can also delay Carve and Spit and a Shadowbringer charge into the phase 2 opener from phase 1 if you want, especially if you're holding DPS at the end of phase 1.

Your pre-Diamond Dust mana management will vary somewhat depending on P1 killtime. You need to refresh Darkside to 60 seconds after the Quadruple Slap to keep it through the downtime. Passive generation during Diamond Dust is around 2600, and you need to refresh again after returning. With high mana and a Dark Arts proc going in, that means 2 Edge of Shadows at the start, TBN during, and Edge of Shadow after Quadruple Slap if not invulning, or just Edge of Shadow after if you are, then TBN after the Diamond Dust cast starts. 

The goal is to end the uptime phase with ~3-6k mana and a Dark Arts proc. You mana will be on the lower side if you can't get Delirium combo hits before the downtime. Weave Edge of Shadow after coming back and use TBN on a squishy to maintain Darkside through the burst window. It may be a DPS gain to simply let Darkside drop during the transition if you are lower on mana and can trade the Darkside buff on the Hard Slash + Edge of Shadow for another EoS in buffs.

Dark Missionary can cover both the knockback and the baited puddles in Diamond Dust.

Hold 1 mins (Delirium, Carve and Spit) for 2 min buffs after Diamond Dust. Edge of Shadow after the boss Scythe Kicks during Mirror Mirror to keep Darkside through Light Rampant (you will naturally do this with faster P1 killtimes).
 
Reprisal can cover both the Banish stack/spreads before Light Rampant and the Light Rampant cast itself. It is also possible to keep your combo through the Light Rampant downtime if your GCD roll aligns properly. Press your last GCD at the second pulse of the AoE markers.
You can precast Delirium as the boss reappears during Light Rampant if you are not trying to keep your combo rolling, or at the voiceline if you are. Weave Carve and Spit immediately after Scarlet Delirium so you can use it again on your crystal.
