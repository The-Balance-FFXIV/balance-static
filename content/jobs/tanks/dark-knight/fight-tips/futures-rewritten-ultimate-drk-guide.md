# Introduction

This guide contains suggestions on how to use your cooldowns effectively, and tips and tricks to play each phase as effectively as possible.

Dark Knight is a very strong tank in FRU at both main and off-tank, and its ability to move gauge usage (and therefore damage) around for whichever phase you need the most damage is invaluable during progression.

# Gear

Dark Knight BiS for FRU can be found at the following link: [https://xivgear.app/#/bis/drk/ultimate/fru](https://xivgear.app/#/bis/drk/ultimate/fru), which will always be kept up to date and have a variety of options. 

Both 2.50 and 2.46 GCD speeds are comfortable during this fight, so we recommend choosing whichever speed you feel most comfortable on. 

# Phase One: Fatebreaker

## Opener

We recommend the following opener for Phase One as off-tank. If you're the main tank, this will also work with minor adjustments (in particular, you should of course start with your stance on, and you may wish to pull with **Unmend** for better boss positioning):

The prepull **TBN** is optional. Fatebreaker queues an auto instantly, so if the MT is not the first to aggro the boss, **TBN** won't break if they parry/block the second auto.

It may help to start the pull at an angle rather than directly south to avoid GCD rollback.
2.46 can **Unmend** pull, but 2.50 will very likely ghost the last **Souleater** with it. You have enough clipping allowance at 2.50 to **Edge** -> **Hard Slash**

If choosing to use potions in this phase, you should use your pot before **Shadowstride** at 2.50 or after **Unmend** at 2.46. Remember that it has a 0.6s animation lock, so it should ideally be used 0.6s before your pulling skill.

The **Salted Earth** allows an extra usage pre-Diamond Dust barring very fast Phase One killtime.

You can turn **Grit** on wherever, but it's nice to pick a consistent weave slot so you don't forget it.

Last **Edge** is timed to hit the end of buffs while keeping Darkside up through Fall of Faith downtime.

Wait a fraction of a second until the Powder Mark Trail castbar ends to press **Shadowed Vigil**. If the **Shadowed Vigil** weave pushes your last **Edge** out of buffs, you can move it up a GCD just for the excog effect rather than mit + excog.

## The Rest of the Phase

Powder Mark hits much harder on the first hit than the second. **Rampart** can last through both hits, but **Shadowed Vigil** cannot. Use **Rampart** on the first regardless of whether you're main tank (MT) or off tank (OT), and add **Dark Mind** + 2x **Oblation** after the boss starts his quote and use **The Blackest Night** (TBN) as you go to your spread spot.

Pre-cast **Delirium** near the end of Utopian Sky. There are three indicators for this: the end of the Burnt Strike cast-bar, the start of the "B" in the Brightfire cast, or when debuffs hit 9 seconds.

**Dark Missionary** can cover 2-3 hits of Fall of Faith plus the following Burnished Glory. The earliest you can use it is as the first tether resolves, though it's recommended to err on the side of caution, as Burnished Glory is by far the most important cast to cover. Reprisal does not work on the Fall of Faith tethers that don't originate from Fatebreaker himself.

**Shadowed Vigil** can be used during the Burnished Glory cast before the second Power Mark. **Living Dead**, **Dark Mind**, and **Oblation** can be used after it finishes. Use **Rampart** during the cast to keep it through the second hit.

You can get a GCD as the last fire/lightning cleave goes off, but it is extremely risky with lightning at a 2.50 GCD speed. **Disesteem** can be held for GCD uptime there.

The Powder Mark followup explosions don't apply vulns and do about half as much damage as the initial hits, so it's possible with heavy mit to gapclose back to the boss and stack them together. Do not do this unless everyone is aware of and prepared for it.

The minimum amount of MP you need to spend is 2 **Edge of Shadow**s after downtime, 1 **TBN** on Burnished/Powder Mark, spend Dark Arts proc, then **TBN** again for second Powder Mark hit. You can also carry **Carve and Spit** and 1 **Shadowbringer** charge into Phase Two.

# Phase Two: Usurper of Frost

Oblation can last through both hits of Quadruple Slap with no special timing and TBN is usually better for the second hit, but most players will choose to invuln it instead. If the other tank is invulning Quadruple Slap, it's recommended that you Provoke after the second hit to save the healers from having to **Esuna** the vulnerability debuff that also amplifies the fallowup auto-attacks.

If you have **Delirium** before Diamond Dust, use it or lose it. This will only happen with a slow phase 1 kill. You can also delay **Carve and Spit** and a **Shadowbringer** charge into the phase 2 opener from phase 1 if you want, especially if you're holding DPS at the end of phase 1.

Your pre-Diamond Dust MP management will vary somewhat depending on Phase One killtime. You need to refresh Darkside to 60 seconds after the Quadruple Slap to keep it through the downtime. Passive generation during Diamond Dust is around 2600, and you need to refresh again after returning. With high MP and a Dark Arts proc going in, that means 2 **Edge of Shadow**s at the start, **TBN** during, and **Edge of Shadow** after Quadruple Slap if not invulning, or just Edge of Shadow after if you are, then **TBN** after the Diamond Dust cast starts. 

The goal is to end the uptime phase with ~3-6k MP and a Dark Arts proc. Your MP will be on the lower side if you can't get Delirium combo hits before the downtime. Weave **Edge of Shadow** after coming back to maintain Darkside through your burst window and **TBN** a squishy for the Hallowed Ray line stack.

**Dark Missionary** can cover both the knockback and the baited puddles in Diamond Dust.

Hold 1 mins (**Delirium**, **Carve and Spit**) for 2 min buffs after Diamond Dust. Edge of Shadow after the boss Scythe Kicks during Mirror Mirror to keep Darkside through Light Rampant (you will naturally do this with faster Phase One killtimes).

**Reprisal** can cover both the Banish stack/spreads before Light Rampant and the Light Rampant cast itself. **Dark Missionary** can cover the puddle drops plus stacks if used after the boss goes untargetable, but can't be used for Light Rampant if it was used for Diamond Dust. 

It is possible to keep your combo through the Light Rampant downtime if your GCD roll aligns properly. Press your last GCD at the second pulse of the AoE markers. You can precast Delirium as the boss reappears during Light Rampant if you are not trying to keep your combo rolling, or at the voice-line if you are. Weave **Carve and Spit** immediately after **Scarlet Delirium** so you can use it again on your crystal.

Save everything you can for intermission. It may be a DPS gain on your crystal to simply let Darkside drop during the transition if you are lower on MP and can trade the Darkside buff on the **Hard Slash** + **Edge of Shadow** for another **Edge of Shadow** in buffs.

# Phase Three: Oracle of Darkness

You can keep your combo rolling through the intermission, but it is fairly tight. You GCD roll needs to be less than about 80% complete when the veil dies to carry over.

**TBN** will break on yourself on the Ultimate Relativity cast. Spending down as much as you can there will set you up for the post-Rewind burst. Depending on how quickly your party buffs afterwards, you may be able to hit buffs while pre-cast **Living Shadow** just before getting stunned.

2.46 GCD lines up to let you roll your GCD as you take your fire out during Ultimate Relativity, with very little leeway.

During Apocalypse, make sure to move in as the Dark Eruption castbar finishes to avoid getting hit by an Apocalypse circle.

**Reprisal** and **Missionary** can cover the final raidwide (Shockwave Pulsar) plus enrage raidwide (Memory's End), with fairly tight timing (needs to be around the "P" in "Pulsar," and it can be difficult to get both Reprisal and Missionary on time).

# Phase Four: Usurper of Frost and Oracle of Darkness

Use a **Shadowbringer** charge out of buffs at the start. It is theoretically possible to get a two-target cleave without incurring any loss, but this is GCD-perfect on hitting buffs in Phase Five and will lose a use in that phase if you kill faster than about 80% of the way through the enrage castbar. 

Delirium needs to be used at the Darklit Dragonsong cast at the latest to gain a use before Crystallize Time. **Carve and Spit** can be used in buffs.

You may choose to have a tank invuln the Somber Dance in Darklit. This can either be one of the tanks regardless of chain/no chain (more difficult to execute) or whichever tank doesn't have chain (one invuln for the price of two). If you invuln this, you will have it for the second Phase Five tower but not the first.

**Reprisal** and **Dark Missionary** can cover both Akh Morn and the following Morn Afah. A popular strategy involves having one tank solo their boss's Akh Morn while the rest of the party does a 7-stack (sometimes known as 7-1). This does not require extreme amounts of mitigation—you can save **Shadowed Vigil** for Crystallize Time if doing this—and adds a lot of comfort/wiggle room for healers.

You can keep Darkside through Crystallize Time if you refresh to 60 seconds at the end of the cast. Count on gaining about 4k MP during the mechanic.

You can use **Shadowed Vigil** after dropping rewind in Crystallize Time to survive potential vulnerability mistakes. You can also put Dark Missionary here (on top of other mits) to help prevent DPS deaths from non-tankbuster vuln hits.

You can use your **Shadowbringer** charge and **Salted Earth** after coming back without losing them in the Phase Five opener, but do not use **Living Shadow**. Total MP generation during transition is around 5200, so try to end the phase with around 4k MP and a Dark Arts proc. This will likely involve two **Edges of Shadow**s plus **TBN**.

While you might recognize that it can be possible, with some adjustments, to use **Living Shadow** during Crystallize Time to gain a use before Phase Five, doing so is **strongly** discouraged. This will disalign **Living Shadow** from buffs, which will be an overall DPS loss in most group compositions, as well as only being possible at all with slow Phase One killtimes. 

# Phase Five: Pandora

**Salted Earth** should be used on a 2 min CD for this phase, in buffs, as you do not lose a use.

**Shadowed Vigil** can be used after the Paradise Regained castbar ends. 10-second mitigations need to be used after the "W" in the Wings Dark and Light cast to last through both hits. Save **TBN** for the second hit on whichever tank is not invulning.

Hitting **Rampart**/**Shadowed Vigil** to deal with auto-attack damage during the Fulgent Blade 'exalines' helps quite a bit. You can use them on the first set if using cooldowns on the second Wings, or on the third set if using cooldowns on the first Wings. 

MP plan for this phase is a fairly standard 5/2. You can bank your first Dark Arts proc on Pandora's Box if you started the phase with less than 9k MP, or on the Polarizing Paths before it. Your second proc can be on the second Polarizing Paths or the third Fulgent Blade.

Best of luck on your clear!
