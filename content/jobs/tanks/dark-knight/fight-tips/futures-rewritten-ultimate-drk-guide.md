# Introduction

This guide contains suggestions on how to use your cooldowns effectively, and tips and tricks to play each phase as effectively as possible.

Both 2.50 and 2.46 GCD speeds are comfortable during this fight, so we recommend choosing whatever speed you feel most comfortable on.

# Phase 1: Fatebreaker

Use a standard opener for this fight. 2.50 GCD with an Unmend pull is very tight on the last GCD in first uptime phase, but it is possible if the pull isn't early. You can adjust Salted Earth to be earlier in the opener to gain a use before the Diamond Dust downtime in phase 2.

Powder Mark hits much harder on the first hit than the second. Rampart can last through both hits, but Shadowed Vigil cannot. Use Rampart on the first regardless of whether you're main tank (MT) or off tank (OT), and add Dark Mind + 2x Oblation after the boss starts his quote and use The Blackest Night (TBN) as you go to your spread spot.

Pre-cast Delirium near the end of Utopian Sky. There are three indicators for this: the end of the Burnt Strike castbar, the start of the "B" in the Brightfire cast, or when debuffs hit 9 seconds.

Dark Missionary can cover 2-3 hits of Fall of Faith plus the following Burnished Glory. The earliest you can use it is as the first tether resolves, though it's recommended to err on the side of caution, as Burnished Glory is by far the most important cast to cover. Reprisal does not work on the Fall of Faith tethers that don't originate from Fatebreaker himself.

Shadowed Vigil can be used during the Burnished Glory cast before the second Power Mark. Living Dead, Dark Mind, and Oblation can be used after it finishes. Use Rampart during the cast to keep it through the second hit.

You can get a GCD as the last fire/lightning cleave goes off, but it is extremely risky with lightning at a 2.50 GCD speed. Disesteem can be held for GCD uptime there.

The minimum amount of mana you need to spend is 2 Edge of Shadows after downtime, 1 TBN on Burnished/Powder Mark, spend Dark Arts proc, then TBN again for second Powder Mark hit. You can also carry Carve and Spit and 1 Shadowbringer charge into Phase 2.

# Phase 2: Usurper of Frost

Oblation can last through both hits of Quadruple Slap with no special timing and TBN is usually better for the second hit, but most players will choose to invuln it instead. If the other tank is invulning Quadruple Slap, it's recommended that you Provoke after the second hit to save the healers from having to Esuna the vulnerability from the tank invulning the full tankbuster.

If you have Delirium before Diamond Dust, use it or lose it. This will only happen with a slow phase 1 kill. You can also delay Carve and Spit and a Shadowbringer charge into the phase 2 opener from phase 1 if you want, especially if you're holding DPS at the end of phase 1.

Your pre-Diamond Dust mana management will vary somewhat depending on P1 killtime. You need to refresh Darkside to 60 seconds after the Quadruple Slap to keep it through the downtime. Passive generation during Diamond Dust is around 2600, and you need to refresh again after returning. With high mana and a Dark Arts proc going in, that means 2 Edge of Shadows at the start, TBN during, and Edge of Shadow after Quadruple Slap if not invulning, or just Edge of Shadow after if you are, then TBN after the Diamond Dust cast starts. 

The goal is to end the uptime phase with ~3-6k mana and a Dark Arts proc. You mana will be on the lower side if you can't get Delirium combo hits before the downtime. Weave Edge of Shadow after coming back and use TBN on a squishy to maintain Darkside through the burst window. It may be a DPS gain to simply let Darkside drop during the transition if you are lower on mana and can trade the Darkside buff on the Hard Slash + Edge of Shadow for another EoS in buffs.

Dark Missionary can cover both the knockback and the baited puddles in Diamond Dust.

Hold 1 mins (Delirium, Carve and Spit) for 2 min buffs after Diamond Dust. Edge of Shadow after the boss Scythe Kicks during Mirror Mirror to keep Darkside through Light Rampant (you will naturally do this with faster P1 killtimes).
 
Reprisal can cover both the Banish stack/spreads before Light Rampant and the Light Rampant cast itself. It is also possible to keep your combo through the Light Rampant downtime if your GCD roll aligns properly. Press your last GCD at the second pulse of the AoE markers.
You can precast Delirium as the boss reappears during Light Rampant if you are not trying to keep your combo rolling, or at the voiceline if you are. Weave Carve and Spit immediately after Scarlet Delirium so you can use it again on your crystal.

# Phase 3: Oracle of Darkness

You can keep your combo rolling through the intermission, but it is quite tight.

TBN will break on yourself on the Ultimate Relativity cast. Spending down as much as you can there will set you up for the post-Rewind burst. Pre-cast Living Shadow just before getting stunned.

2.46 GCD lines up to let you roll your GCD as you take your fire out during Ultimate Relativity, with very little leeway.

During Apocalypse, make sure to move in as the Dark Eruption castbar finishes to avoid getting hit by an Apocalypse circle.

Reprisal and Missionary can cover the final raidwide (Shockwave Pulsar) plus enrage raidwide (Memory's End), with fairly tight timing (needs to be around the "P" in "Pulsar," and it can be difficult to get both Reprisal and Missionary on time).

# Phase 4: Usurper of Frost and Oracle of Darkness

Use a Shadowbringer charge out of buffs at the start. It is theoretically possible to get a two-target cleave without incurring any loss, but this is GCD-perfect on hitting buffs in P5.
Delirium needs to be used at the Darklit Dragonsong cast to gain a use before CT. Carve can be used in buffs. You should hold Salted Earth for two-target cleave.

You may choose to have a tank invuln the Somber Dance in Darklit. This can either be one of the tanks regardless of chain/no chain (more difficult to execute) or whichever tank doesn't have chain (one invuln for the price of two). If you invuln this, you will have it for the second Phase 5 tower but not the first.

Reprisal and Dark Missionary can cover both Akh Morn and the following Morn Afah. A popular strategy involves having one tank solo their boss's Akh Morn while the rest of the party does a 7-stack (sometimes known as 7-1). This does not require extreme amounts of mitigation and adds a lot of comfort/wiggle room for healers.

Use Shadowed Vigil after dropping rewind in Crystallize Time to survive potential vulnerability mistakes. You can also put Dark Missionary here (on top of other mits) to help prevent DPS deaths from non-tankbuster vuln hits.

Go into Crystallize Time with low mana and Dark Arts, and use Shadowbringer after Crystallize Time, you'll get two stacks back during cutscene. You can also use two Edges of Shadow and TBN after Crystallize Time, as you get roughly 5200 MP gen during transition.

# Phase 5: Pandora

Salted Earth should be used on a 2 min CD for this phase, in buffs, as you do not lose a use.

You will likely want to invuln one of the Wings Dark and Light tankbusters. If you're able to, this frees up your conventional mitigations for exawaves.

Best of luck on your clear!
