DRK is a flexible class, and so specific encounters may benefit from alternate openers.
Encounter-specific opener information may be found in the [drk_encounter channel of the Balance discord](https://discord.com/channels/277897135515762698/1264618936297848926), or on fight-specific guides, where applicable.

This section will list general-purpose DRK openers, which will work well for most situations, and provide an overview of how openers are chosen. For more nuance, understanding, and detail about why some encounters might prefer a different opener, you may also want to read the [opener variation section in the advanced guide](/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/advanced-guide/#opener-variations).

## Opener Design Goals
* Use as many big hits and spend as much MP as possible inside potion and raid buff windows (which typically come up around the third or fourth GCD). This means that most skills will be delayed until this point.
* Get **Living Shadow** out early enough that its attacks fully fit into buffs. Its long spawn animation and the fact that it updates with buffs in real time means that it is best used before buffs come out, unlike skills that apply damage immediately.
* Use an Edge of Shadow to apply Darkside as early as possible.
* Avoid overcapping on MP.


Tanks currently use **Grade 3 Gemdraughts of Strength**.
<br>Note that Strength affects both physical and magical skills for tanks.

## Standard Opener

![7.2 Standard Dark Knight Opener](/img/drk_opener_7_2.png "Standard")

> Text version: <br/>
> Prepull **The Blackest Night** (-3) <br/> 
> **Unmend** (-1), Potion, **Edge of Shadow**, <br/> 
> **Hard Slash** + **Living Shadow**, <br/>
> **Syphon Strike**, <br/>
> **Souleater** + **Delirium**, <br/>
> **Disesteem** + **Salted Earth** + **Edge of Shadow**, <br/>
> Scarlet Delirium + Shadowbringer + **Edge of Shadow**, <br/>
> **Comeuppance** + **Carve and Spit** + **Edge of Shadow**, <br/>
> **Torcleaver** + **Shadowbringer** + **Edge of Shadow**, <br/>
> **Bloodspiller** + **Salt and Darkness**

### Opener notes
* **Unmend** is used to delay the opener slightly to account for raid buff application time. Use it whether or not you are pulling.
* Early use of **Disesteem** (before the **Torcleaver** combo) avoids some minor MP overcap.

### Optional Modifications
* If the prepull TBN will not break, it can be left out for a small MP loss. This does not change the rest of the opener substantially, although the last **Edge of Shadow** may get pushed further back.
* **Shadowstride** can be used to pull instead of **Unmend**, and pulling with **Hard Slash** is also viable if the boss starts in melee range, but each of these options requires adding an extra **Hard Slash** before **Disesteem** to ensure that the burst fits into late-applied buffs. However, if you are the pulling tank, this can make positioning harder. There is more detail on this opener and its benefits and potential drawbacks in [a section in the advanced guide.](/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/advanced-guide/#opening-with-shadowstride)
* If you cannot fit the **Edge of Shadow** before **Hard Slash** without clipping due to, for example, the boss being far away, move it to after **Hard Slash**. I.e., **Unmend** -> Potion -> **Hard Slash** -> **Edge of Shadow** -> **Living Shadow**.
