If HP drops to 0 while active, status will change to Walking Dead, with a duration of ten seconds. While under the effect of Walking Dead, most attacks will not drop your HP below 1, and you will heal for 1500 potency per target hit with weaponskills or spells. If you are healed for an amount equal to 100% of your maximum HP, Walking Dead is replaced with the Undead Rebirth buff, retaining its duration. Undead Rebirth prevents most attacks from dropping your HP below 1, but does not have the healing effect of Walking Dead. If the Walking Dead debuff expires without being converted into Undead Rebirth, you will be KO'd. |
