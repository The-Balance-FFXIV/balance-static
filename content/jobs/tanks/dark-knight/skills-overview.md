# Offensive On Global Cooldown (GCD) Abilities

These abilities are Weaponskills, which will use your Global Cooldown (GCD) recast, which is by default 2.50, or faster if you have Skill Speed. For Dark Knight, there are three exceptions, **Unmend**, **Unleash**, and **Stalwart Soul**, which are Spells, and therefore reduced by Spell Speed, instead of Skill Speed. Practically speaking, this means they will always have a 2.50 recast.

If HP drops to 0 while active, status will change to Walking Dead, with a duration of ten seconds. While under the effect of Walking Dead, most attacks will not drop your HP below 1, and you will heal for 1500 potency per target hit with weaponskills or spells. If you are healed for an amount equal to 100% of your maximum HP, Walking Dead is replaced with the Undead Rebirth buff, retaining its duration. Undead Rebirth prevents most attacks from dropping your HP below 1, but does not have the healing effect of Walking Dead. If the Walking Dead debuff expires without being converted into Undead Rebirth, you will be KO'd. |
