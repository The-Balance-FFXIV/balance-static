# Introduction

This guide focuses on advanced level 100 Dark Knight gameplay, and assumes that you are comfortable with the entirety of the Dark Knight kit as well as its opener and rotation. If you're still leveling, you should start with [the leveling guide](/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide), and if you're still learning, you should start with the [the basic guide](/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/basic-guide), and build familiarity with the kit first.

Trying to apply these techniques before you're fully comfortable with the rotation and job could make your gameplay worse, not better.

# Unmend and GCD Downtime

Unmend is a pretty bad ability. It has a mere 150 potency, and to rub salt in the wound, it's a Spell, so if we have Skill Speed, it doesn't even apply to Unmend. Though, it's still better to use a bad GCD than to spend time you could be using a GCD doing nothing during forced melee downtime.

Some of the best advice you can receive as you're learning is to Always Be Casting, i.e. making sure your GCD is rolling at all times. This remains great advice and especially if you're still getting used to a fight, is still worth doing with Unmend rather than doing nothing.

But this is the advanced guide, so we can be a lot more nuanced than Always Be Casting. For us, it's not always correct to keep the GCD rolling for small amounts of GCD downtime. Our 123 combo has an average potency of 387, and that's not even counting the resource gain from Syphon Strike and Souleater. In comparison, Unmend's 150 potency is 38% of our average 123 GCD potency of 387. As a result, if you're only going to lose about second of your GCD rolling, it's usually better to not press Unmend and wait until you can use your 123 at the soonest opportunity instead.

We can make this into a rule of thumb based on the 38% number. 38% of 2.5 seconds is 0.95 seconds, so if you're kept away from the boss for only ~1.5 seconds or less, it may be better to not use Unmend, and wait until you get back to the boss to continue your 123 combo instead. Of course, if we're away from the boss for more than 1.5 seconds, and especially if we're away from the boss for 2.5 seconds or more, it's still correct to press Unmend rather than do no damage.

# Application Delay, Resources, and How to Be a Time Criminal

In FFXIV, abilities first consume their resources, and then apply their effects. The time between the cooldown starting and the ability's effects happening (both *applying* its damage and *applying* its other effects) is called the application delay of the ability. This primarily matters for us because of Blood Weapon's 600 MP gain on GCDs. The 600 MP is gained upon ability application, which means you can do something that would overcap MP, but spend it by using Edge of Shadow before the ability application. 

For most abilities, the application delay is low enough that we cannot realistically weave an Edge of Shadow before the ability (and MP gain, which could be granted by Blood Weapon) applies. You cannot use Syphon Strike (which has the 'standard' application delay of 0.62s) and use an Edge of Shadow before you gain the 600 MP from the Syphon Strike. However, Disesteem is an exception. Disesteem, has a 1.65s application time, meaning it's both possible and very comfortable to perform 'time crimes' with it.

For example, if you have 9600 MP and Blood Weapon active, you can use Disesteem, immediately weave Edge of Shadow, and not overcap MP, as the Edge of Shadow will spend MP before Disesteem (and the Blood Weapon buff that modified it to give you +600 MP) applies. If you were to use Hard Slash in the same situation, you would overcap MP.

Another ability where the application delay is worth knowing is Carve and Spit, which has an application delay of 1.47s, similarly allowing an Edge of Shadow weave before the MP gain applies.

This can come up in practical situations if you're going into burst with an especially high amount of MP. In these situations, you want to save Disesteem for the GCD where you'd normally overcap. If you have, for example, 9000 MP and a Dark Arts proc, then with Blood Weapon and Delirium up, using Disesteem -> Edge of Shadow -> Scarlet Delirium -> Edge of Shadow would overcap MP, whereas Scarlet Delirium -> Edge of Shadow -> Disesteem -> Edge of Shadow would not.

# Salted Earth, Buff Windows, and 90s Cooldowns

Salted Earth is a weird in that it has a 90s cooldown, unlike most other damaging cooldowns in the game. Regardless, it's best to use Salted Earth off cooldown rather than save it for buffs, since more uses of the ability will always trump less uses in buff windows. This only changes when you know the killtime and you know you wouldn't lose a use to hold the ability for buffs. For example, if you're killing the boss after 8:30, then you wouldn't lose a use of Salted Earth if you held the one you'd use around 1:30 to the 2m burst window. This also shifts the 7:30 Salted Earth to the 8m window, allowing us to pot in the 2m and 8m burst window (instead of the 0m and 6m burst window) without losing abilities under pot.
