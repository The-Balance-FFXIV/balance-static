# Reaper Intermediate Guide

Welcome to Reaper Intermediate Guide! The objective of this guide is to tackle some of the more slightly complicated part of Reaper. This guide will cover the following topics:



* Variant Openers
* Standard Two-Minute Burst Window
* Variant Two-Minute Burst Windows
* Uptime Optimization
* Dead Zoning
* The 10 Minute Window
* Potion Optimization





## Variant Openers

As of Dawntrail launch we only have one Variant opener: The 2nd GCD Arcane Circle Opener

The Objective of this opener is two-fold:

* Provides a more optimized Potion window, at the cost of a less optimal Arcane Circle Window
* Aligns Arcane Circle with any raid buffs that go off at the 2nd GCD AC.



As of writing this, this may become our standard opener but only if the 2nd GCD AC alignment provides the raid more DPS than it does the Reaper. This currently seems unlikely so it will most likely be relagated to an opener potion optimization instead. This opener also isn't really different from the 3rd GCD AC one we have posted on the basic guide with a just oGCDs being shuffled around in the opener.

This opener will also be impossible for people with high ping who can not double weave potions. 



## Two Minute Burst Windows



Optimizing your two minute burst window to better play into buffs is what really set you apart as a Reaper. An optimized Double Enshroud Window is putting around 1000 more potency into raid buffs than an optimized Single Enshroud one. Reaper has a lot of options for Burst windows and some win out based on the number of raid buffs you have or even win out based on the current timeline of the fight you are in. Below is the safest option for your two minute burst window, that will work best in most situations.  For nomenclature purposes you often hear to this as either DDR (Death's Design Retain) or Neutral Burst:

There are some variables at play here. In a full-uptime scenario you will find that this rotation will almost always prefer the Perfectio Route, but default to the Combo Route at around the 8 minute timer. Ideally, though, the perfect burst sequence for us will end in Gluttony -> Executioner's which is slightly stronger than any Perfectio option. This also opens up Perfectio to be used as a range tool.



There are a few extra conditions that couldn't fit into this infograph, I will go over all the routes below:

* Gluttony Route - This is our highest damage end sequence but also has the most restrictive use case. We must be combo neutral, meaning your last combo action before enshroud should have been an infernal. You also need to ensure that Gluttony will be up by the end of the burst window which is somewhere around 24s on its CD whenever you hit your first enshroud. Once Gluttony drifts from the burst once, this sequence can not be used again.
* Perfectio Route - Probably the most common route, this actually ends our Burst on Perfectio and allows us to barely retain our combo action afterwards. In order to execute this you must not need Perfectio for maintaining uptime and the last weaponskill you did before entering enshroud must have been a combo action (alternatively this is doable if you enter enshroud combo neutral).

  * If you do enter enshroud combo neutral than instead of a combo action after Perfectio you will instead opt for Soul Slice.
* Combo Route - This is the route you take if enter your burst window in a combo and your last GCD was not a combo action. In order to not drop Combo you must use it right after Communio. This will happened naturally in a full uptime fight around the 8 minute mark. You will also want to use this route if you are able to utilize Perfectio to replace a Harpe within the next 30s.



### Variant Two Minute Bursts



Currently we have two additional variants to our burst window serving entirely different purposes.



![](/img/jobs/rpr/reaper_standard_double-shroud_death_designs_drop_ddd.png "Death's Design Drop")



This burst window has the same variable endings as above but there are a few key differences. In a full uptime scenario this burst sequence will always enter Combo neutral, meaning if gauge permits we can always close our burst with the stronger Gluttony Route. The downside is that Death's Design will fall on re-application. If we ignore auto-attacks this burst window is theoretically better than the standard we posted above, unfortunately auto attacks throw a potential wrench in how we evaluate these windows. I'd recommend keeping an eye out, because if auto-attacks are not at risk of losing Death's Design then this may become our new standard.



This Burst window does have an excellent use in standard though, as a sort of swap off at the 8 minute mark in a full uptime scenario -- potentially sooner if gauge gets strained. You can use this to avoid the "Combo Route" of DDR by injecting another combo GCD after the non-combo GCD. This will allow you to end the burst on the Perfectio route. If you don't want to have to juggle two, maybe three burst sequences in a fight you can just default to DDD at a minimal potential potency loss.



#### Combo Entry Point

One of the neat things about Dawntrail Reaper is that Perfectio fills in a role that used to be occupied by a 19th combo GCD. This means we will do 18 combo GCDs between each burst sequence. In full-uptime scenarios you will most likely always enter your burst on the same combo point, the caveat here is that every Harpe and Harvest Moon will shift this combo window by one GCD. So there are cases, like a 2 ranged GCD filler rotation where DDR will enter combo neutral.



#### Single Enshroud Burst

In Endwalker Single Enshroud was significantly weaker than our Double Enshroud burst. In Dawntrail it is now a lot closer. With Gluttony being a much stronger GCD with its two 820p follow up attacks we now need to take more consideration of losing a use. The best way to prevent losing that use is to utilize a single enshroud window. This is only effective if you have not performed any of the above burst sequences and is still a gain all the way up until the 8 minute mark if it would give us an extra usage of Gluttony and both Executioners.



Placeholder for Image



The biggest consideration for single enshroud windows is how close together AC and Gluttony can be together and where you put your combo finisher / soul slice. These sort of solve themselves though and don't require much planning as long as you prioritize hitting AC on CD and using Gluttony where it won't clip. There is also a slightly more advanced variation of this that carries over 50 shroud and enters Enshroud before Plentiful Harvest, allowing you to store Perfectio Occulta and potentially replace a Harpe -- or even gain a GCD if casted Harpe and Enhanced Harpe are not possible. That variation will be touched more later on in this guide.





### Uptime Optimization



Reaper received a major change in Dawntrail, that being that Harvest Moon and Harpe now generate 10 Soul. Reaper also received a new action in their rotation that generates no Soul -- Perfectio. Because of this the risk of not having enough gauge intensifies meaning that with enough wasted downtime the burst window at even 8 minutes could be in jeopardy. One of the challenges will be for RPR to utilize their ranged tools to maintaining uptime for not only more damage but also to ensure that their rotation later down the line doesn't suffer.



* Harvest Moon is your first line of uptime defense. You only get one in any encounter where the boss doesn't leave the arena for 4s or more and using it to maintain uptime is crucial. It is instant cast and is 800p, meaning using it at any point in the fight will always be a gain.
* Perfectio is your second line of uptime defense and arguable the most complicated piece. In standard burst sequences Perfectio can be brought outside of the burst for potential uptime gains within 30s of the final Communio. By using Perfectio, instead of Harpe, you more-or-less secure a combo action which will net you anywhere from 132-330p. 
* Enhanced Harpe is another great option just because its instant cast and will allow for more mobility. You get this from simply using Hell's Ingress or Hell's Regress which are both great tools for maintaining uptime.
* Hard-cast Harpe - Sometimes the teleport skills go to far, or the downtime is extended and we will have to utilize hardcast Harpe. This isn't to terribly difficult with its short cast time.



#### Perfectio Ranged Flex

Perfectio's availability can be stretched out to nearly a minute after Plentiful Harvests or almost 90s after Arcane Circle has been used. This does require some planning to utilize but we do have the ability to utilizing windows such as the one in the spreadsheet below to not sacrifice too much damage in our burst window and also allowing us uptime pretty far into the future. This may be a non-standard optimization or it could be a niche tool for certain encounters, but I believe understanding how good Perfectio as a ranged tool will seperate good from bad reapers.
