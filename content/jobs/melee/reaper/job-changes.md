      * Slice from 300 --> 320

      * Waxing Slice from 380 --> 400

      * Infernal Slice from 460 --> 500




      This change doesn't impact anything rotationally for Reaper is about a 1.5% increase in overall damage
  - patch: "6.28"
    description: >-
      Plentiful Harvest went from 520-800 Potency up to 720-1000 potency.


      Communio went from 1000 potency to 1100 potency.


      Lemure's Slice went from 200 potency to 220 potency


      This is about 2.3% increase and ultimately makes the job more competitive with other melee. All of this damage is in the burst window which also impacts how well a RPR performs in raid buffs.

    description: The radius for our Raid buff, Arcane Circle, has been doubled from
      15y to 30y.
  - patch: "6.5"

      Gluttony went from 500 potency to 520 potency.

      Lemure's Slice went from 220 potency to 240 potency.
