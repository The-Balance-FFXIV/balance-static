  - patch: "6.2"
    description: >-
      The following potencies changed:


      * Slice from 300 --> 320

      * Waxing Slice from 380 --> 400

      * Infernal Slice from 460 --> 500




      This change doesn't impact anything rotationally for Reaper is about a 1.5% increase in overall damage
  - patch: "6.28"
    description: >-
      Plentiful Harvest went from 520-800 Potency up to 720-1000 potency.


      Communio went from 1000 potency to 1100 potency.


      Lemure's Slice went from 200 potency to 220 potency


      This is about 2.3% increase and ultimately makes the job more competitive with other melee. All of this damage is in the burst window which also impacts how well a RPR performs in raid buffs.
  - patch: "6.4"
    description: The range for our Raid buff Arcane Circle has been doubled from 15y to 30y.
