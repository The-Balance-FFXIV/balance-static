    description: BiS built around a 2.49s GCD. The damage difference between this
      set and the 2.5s GCD set will be almost unnoticeably worse. This set does
      not share perfect compatibility with DRG. You can swap the DH melds on the
      chest to DET to have perfect compatibility with DRG for a minor single
      digit DPS loss (estimated at ~4 dps). A 2.49s GCD means Arcane Circle will
      only drift .12-.13 seconds every two minutes potentially allowing for
      better raid alignment. This is currently our recommended option.

    description: BiS built around have a 2.5s GCD. This Set shares full
      compatibility with the 2.5s GCD DRG set. The best option for our personal
      damage by a slight margin but at 2.5s Arcane Circle will drift .5s every
      two minutes. This could cause problems with alignment or fight specific
      needs.

    description: This is a good set to start with if you plan to go into the
      Anabaseios savage tier. This is one of three possible sets that you can go
      for. The set shown above only features the crafted set with one normal
      raid piece. The normal raid earring beats the crafted set earring if the
      latter is not pentamelded.

      If using the scythe from DSR, meld two Direct Hit X's and one
      Determination X. If you want full compatibility with DRG after acquiring
      the DSR weapon, change the SKS meld on the head piece to DET and then do
      DH DH SKS on the weapon.


      Note: The 615 and 630 versions of the Manderville weapons sync identically in DSR and are therefore the same. Use whichever you have available.
