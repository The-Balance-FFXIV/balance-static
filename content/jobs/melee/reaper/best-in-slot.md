    description: BiS set designed around a 2.49 GCD while using the final step of
      the Manderville weapon. This set does not share compatibility with DRG,
      however, due to differing melds. If you do not care about compatibility
      with DRG, use this set, otherwise use the DRG compatible Relic option.

    description: Built around a 2.49 GCD, this set trades a minor DPS loss for more
      compatibility with DRG's BiS to avoid needing to remeld frequently when
      playing both jobs. The Skill Speed meld will still need to be swapped out
      when playing DRG. If you do not wish to remeld frequently, you can fully
      use DRG 2.5 BiS melds and use Baba Ghanoush food instead of Baked Eggplant
      for an estimated 20 DPS loss in exchange for no longer needing to remeld
      for 2.49 on RPR.

      This is the original Anabaseios Savage BiS before the final Manderville
      step was released. Use this if you don't have the final Manderville weapon
      step.

      BiS built around a 2.49s GCD.  A 2.49s GCD means Arcane Circle will only drift .12-.13 seconds every two minutes potentially allowing for better raid alignment. This is currently our recommended option.

      This is a good set to start with if you plan to go into the Anabaseios
      savage tier. This is one of three possible sets that you can go for. The
      set shown above only features the crafted set with one normal raid piece.
      The normal raid earring beats the crafted set earring if the latter is not
      pentamelded.




      As of 6.5 there are a lot of options for getting gear that is i640+. 


      Just follow this simple priority for gearing until you get BiS pieces:


      * Take the highest iLvl piece available to you

      * Follow meld priority for non BiS pieces

      * For options within the same iLvl, prioritize pieces that do not have skill speed

      * Replace with BiS pieces when possible

      If using the scythe from DSR, meld two Direct Hit X's and one
      Determination X. If you want full compatibility with DRG after acquiring
      the DSR weapon, change the SKS meld on the head piece to DET and then do
      DH DH SKS on the weapon.


      Note: The 645 and 665 versions of the Manderville weapon are functionally the same in DSR. Use whichever you have and allocate the stats as shown in the etro link.

      Recommended gearset to prog TOP as of patch 6.5. This set includes the
      Dungeon Gear from patch 6.5, putting this set slightly ahead of the other
      option.

    description: This is just the Abyssos 2.49 BiS, which is slightly lower in DPS
      than the Dungeon Gear + Relic option. If using the TOP scythe, meld two
      Direct Hit X's and one Skill Speed X.
