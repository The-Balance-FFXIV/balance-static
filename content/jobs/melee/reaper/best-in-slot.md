      This set runs a 2.45 GCD, which requires some special considerations that
      the normal GCD speed of 2.49 does not! You can see the rotation
      adjustments in [this
      spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f1G2mGqjqfLNcOzci5qDTa2rAF9hbWPaJDTKTz-nLdY/edit?usp=sharing)

      If using the scythe from DSR, meld two Direct Hit X's and one
      Determination X. If you want full compatibility with DRG after acquiring
      the DSR weapon, change the SKS meld on the head piece to DET and then do
      DH DH SKS on the weapon.


      Note: The 645 and 665 versions of the Manderville weapon are functionally the same in DSR. Use whichever you have and allocate the stats as shown in the etro link.

      Recommended gearset to prog TOP as of patch 6.5. This set includes the
      Dungeon Gear from patch 6.5, putting this set slightly ahead of the other
      option.


      Note: The 645 and 665 versions of the Manderville weapons are functionally the same in TOP. Use whichever you have and allocate the stats as shown in the etro link.

      than the Dungeon Gear + Relic option. If using the TOP scythe, meld two
      Direct Hit X's and one Skill Speed X.
