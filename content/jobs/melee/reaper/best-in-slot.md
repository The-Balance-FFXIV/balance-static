      This is the recommended BiS set for most players. It uses a 2.49 GCD
      instead of 2.50 to minimize Arcane Circle misalignment and drift, equating
      to more damage than 2.50.


      Use this set unless you play capped on 60 FPS.

    name: 60 FPS Capped 2.48 BiS
    link: 16ba48d5-6ee4-4d57-8e41-a17ed363c4f0
    description: >-
      Because of how framerate and abilities interact in FFXIV, 2.49 GCD while
      capped at 60 FPS is actually closer to 2.50 GCD. This causes Arcane Circle
      drift and misalignment. This set uses 2.48 GCD to "correct" this while at
      60 FPS, which plays at effectively 2.49 GCD. 


      **Do not use this set unless you are capped at 60 FPS!** 


      Players who are on console should favor this set as console is capped at 60 FPS.

    description: This set is currently the best set available and is slightly
      stronger than the previous BiS set using only 605/600 gear. The 645 and
      665 versions of the endwalker relic sync down to be the exact same weapon,
      so use whichever you have available to you.

      If using the scythe from DSR, meld two Direct Hit X's and one
      Determination X. If you want full compatibility with DRG after acquiring
      the DSR weapon, change the SKS meld on the head piece to DET and then do
      DH DH SKS on the weapon.


      Note: The 645 and 665 versions of the Manderville weapon are functionally the same in DSR. Use whichever you have and allocate the stats as shown in the etro link.
