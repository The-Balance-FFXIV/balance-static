    description: This is the recommended BiS set for most players. This set is fully
      compatible with DRG and SAM BiS, but not with MNK as MNK needs a slightly
      different meld configuration.

    link: https://xivgear.app/?page=embed|sl|887c54fb-ee93-4784-98b8-4260ada6383b
    description: This option uses 3 weeks of tomes before entering savage for week 1
      prog. Do note this set requires an extra 20 tomes that you will need to
      get the day of savage release for this to work.

    description: This set uses three weeks of tomes plus an additional 20 that you
      will need to get before entering savage week 1. This option uses the tome

    description: This set is currently the best set available and is slightly
      stronger than the previous BiS set using only 605/600 gear. The 645 and

      so use whichever you have available to you.

      If using the scythe from DSR, meld two Direct Hit X's and one
      Determination X. If you want full compatibility with DRG after acquiring
      the DSR weapon, change the SKS meld on the head piece to DET and then do
      DH DH SKS on the weapon.


      Note: The 645 and 665 versions of the Manderville weapon are functionally the same in DSR. Use whichever you have and allocate the stats as shown in the etro link.
