    description: BiS built around a 2.49s GCD. The damage difference between this
      set and the 2.5s GCD set will be almost unnoticeably worse. A 2.49s GCD
      means Arcane Circle will only drift .12-.13 seconds every two minutes
      potentially allowing for better raid alignment. This is currently our
      recommended option.

    description: BiS built around have a 2.5s GCD. The best option for our personal
      damage by a slight margin but at 2.5s Arcane Circle will drift .5s every
      two minutes. This could cause problems with alignment or fight specific
      needs.

      **The above gear set is only an example, there are tons of options!**\

      6.3 introduces two new sources of 620 gear and a new 625 weapon. As such it is extremely easy to get at least ilvl 620. Because there are now so many options, pick what is easiest/most affordable for you to get. When choosing between items of the same item level, prioritize items that do not have skill speed where possible. Remember when spending tomes to **buy BiS tome pieces first**. Upgrade the tome pieces with the Alliance Raid tokens and fill in the rest of the pieces with 620 augmented crafted or Alliance Raid pieces until you can get the BiS pieces. If you are not doing savage, just grab the highest ilvl pieces available, which will mean eventually getting all tome pieces and upgrading them to 630 using Alliance Raid tokens. 


      If you want to know specific differences between pieces, consult the Gear Planner as it will heavily depend on what the rest of your gear is!
