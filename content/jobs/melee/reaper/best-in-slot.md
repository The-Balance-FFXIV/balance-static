    description: >-
      This is the recommended BiS set for most players. It uses a 2.49 GCD
      instead of 2.50 to minimize Arcane Circle misalignment and drift, equating
      to more damage than 2.50.


      Use this set unless you play capped on a **stable** 60 FPS.


      This set requires one Skill Speed to Direct Hit remeld to play DRG.

    link: c3d1be67-8202-4e18-97bb-7a5993215c79
    description: >-
      Because of how framerate and abilities interact in FFXIV, 2.49 GCD while
      capped at 60 FPS is actually closer to 2.50 GCD. This causes Arcane Circle
      drift and misalignment. This set uses 2.48 GCD to "correct" this while at
      60 FPS, which plays at effectively 2.49 GCD. 


      **Do not use this set unless you are capped at *stable* 60 FPS!** 


      Players who are on console should favor this set as console is capped at 60 FPS.


      This set requires 2 Skill Speed to Direct Hit remelds to play DRG.

      The best option for week 1 savage prog if you are only going to have one
      week of tomes before entering. There is no need to use pentamelds if you
      are not going for a week 1 kill. 


      Replace pieces with higher item level pieces as you get them.

      The best option for week 1 savage prog if you are going to have enough
      tomes for two accessories before entering. There is no need to use
      pentamelds if you are not going for a week 1 kill. 


      Replace pieces with higher item level pieces as you get them.

    description: >-
      This set is only for players who wish to spend as little as possible. It
      is strongly recommended that you do not use this set if going for a week 1
      kill. 


      Replace more crafted pieces with normal raid pieces that do not have skill speed to reduce the cost further. Meld skill speed to maintain a 2.49 GCD, but do not go faster than this ideally.

    description: This set is currently the best set available and is slightly
      stronger than the previous BiS set using only 605/600 gear. The 645 and
      665 versions of the endwalker relic sync down to be the exact same weapon,
      so use whichever you have available to you.

      If using the scythe from DSR, meld two Direct Hit X's and one
      Determination X. If you want full compatibility with DRG after acquiring
      the DSR weapon, change the SKS meld on the head piece to DET and then do
      DH DH SKS on the weapon.


      Note: The 645 and 665 versions of the Manderville weapon are functionally the same in DSR. Use whichever you have and allocate the stats as shown in the etro link.
