    description: BiS built around have a 2.5s GCD. The best option for our personal
      damage by a slight margin but at 2.5s Arcane Circle will drift .5s every
      two minutes. This could cause problems with alignment or fight specific
      needs.

    description: BiS built around a 2.49s GCD. The damage difference between this
      set and the 2.5s GCD set will be almost unnoticeably worse. A 2.49s GCD
      means Arcane Circle will only drift .12-.13 seconds every two minutes
      potentially allowing for better raid alignment. This is currently our
      recommended option.

      raid then run with this set to get the most out of your gear.

    description: If you are planning on getting the Tome weapon week one then use
      this set to get the most out of your gear. It is generally recommended
      that least one DPS in a static gets assigned the tome weapon as it is a
      significant upgrade. The decision is entirely up to you and your static,
      just know that the Tome weapon will put you a week behind on gearing
      towards BiS.
