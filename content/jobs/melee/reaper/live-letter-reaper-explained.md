Live Letter Reaper Explained

Author: Ellunavi Sevald, from the Balance Discord

If you have made it to this document, it is because you watched the live letter and saw how cool Reaper was and decided you wanted to be one. Upon reading the tooltips you got very confused, lost all spirit and wandered off into the shroud. Well, don’t trade in your soul yet, but grab your sickle instead because I am going to do my best to explain how this job works.

First of all, some big disclaimers:

* We are still missing some tooltips from the live letter, so some information may be incorrect
* Ability names may be changed when they are brought to NA
* There are some interactions we don’t fully grasp yet and would need to be tested
* Potency values will probably change before live, so there potentially may be changes
* I will delete this document around go-live when stuff is updated
* Expect some of this information to change when the patch goes live

Special thanks to Lyra, Aletin, Alice, Mitsu and Ay for getting the translations pretty quick. If you want to see their work please visit here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFjxGQZ9hklNpkKcJAxKzJRNlNtgabcgkuua_scJfOs/edit>

You can also view it in google sheets form here, credit goes to Trav877 for creating this: [Reaper abilities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZvaOB0Gc7-MU_0N5Gy66BzhGHnoh9wOmZ1HSg37VwLQ/edit#gid=0)

Let’s break into the basics of Reaper, since grasping that is the most important thing.

Reaper will be a builder-and-spender class with an interesting and flexible buff window. You will be building a lot of resources and spending them, so please bear with me as I go through them all. Since the resources are the crowning characteristic of Reaper, I will start by breaking them down.

The first gauge we will be looking at is the Soul Gauge. It is the red gauge seen below:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7cP7ZYrHTOVOS4QYNBpUBUfVPaoi5Cgg78j7KhrqdEp2AFsmyAsiq1M8JRaUbJhb6Ob5RnsaxktBdAFbM5_R8Mp0A1gRgaacGhLT-N44IAiPNNGgh6m2lTZa36zJF5W4BqxwRVYY=s0)

How do you get Soul Gauge?

* Using your basic Combo:
* * Single Target basic combo : Slice > Waxing Slash > Infernal Slice
  * AoE Combo : Spinning Scythe > Nightmare Scythe
  * Each of these build 10 Soul Gauge
* Using your “Soul”-like weapon skills:
* * There are two of these
  * * Soul Slice - Single target
    * Soul Scythe - AoE
  * Both build 50 Soul Gauge
  * Both are on the Global Cooldown
  * Both share a cooldown and can store up to 2 charges

Now that you found where you get your soul, you can begin spending to gain Sickles. Sickle is a buff that will allow you to use another weapon skill. Here is how you spend Soul to generate Sickles ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qS2TU9uB444M9E82Or5gUWakH3enUoseV-XV6zRY1d0aBugKOF2bLiL2Rn13q2lfOUFHa-MKSi5ke5FX2OmmXuWMrMzrxLVqc0PhTlsTPoYMYWKXC0Y6OUxYukB2_yiGt4EoHCRW=s0).

* You will use them on single-target “Claw Type” skills:
* * These abilities are: Stalksway, Gibbet Claw, Gallow Claw 
  * As of the LL, we believe this all do effectively the same thing and they share the same button
  * I will discuss what makes it “change” later on, but it is inconsequential to know this as of the LL 
  * They cost 50 Soul
  * They set your Sickle count to 1.
  * * This is important, you can not stack Sickles with these abilities
  * They have a 1s CD
* You can use them on the AoE(Cone) ability Thiefsway:
* * It costs 50 Soul
  * This sets your Sickle count to 1
  * * This is important, you can not stack Sickles with this ability
* You will use them on “Gluttony”:
* * This ability has a 60s cooldown
  * Deals more damage than Stalksway, Thiefsway, Gibbet Claw and Gallow Claw
  * Deals AoE damage around the target.
  * This ability costs 50 Soul Gauge
  * It increases your Sickle count by 2.
  * * Welcome to our first Reaper dilemma.
    * Based on the tooltip, we can assume that if you have 1 Sickle and cast Gluttony you will have 3 Sickles, but this needs to be confirmed.
* Special note: Sickles last 30s

Ok, you have a Sickle, maybe two and who knows you could even have three so what do you do with them? You take them over to the Gibbets and Gallows and generate Shroud which is represented by the blue bar in the gauge below:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_ymu0lW6llkMuGfQvKs1ZBZhGZ-UyvE0luPNaHxocoIw-wtWlzX7F9pKf4sW29urbzbEhJM1E8urNhk21u5anoIPBHglRsaOEQTMAZFTF0YDbF9aTgltIOUHZu9mTNQ5HAFpuzGy=s0)

* Sickles allow you to use three abilities:
* * Gibbet, Gallows and Guillotine
  * They both consume 1 Sickle
  * Gibbet:
  * * Deals more damage from the flank
    * Buffs your next Gallows
    * * Gibbet will actually give you a buff called “Gallows Effect up”
      * * This last for 60s and wears off on your next Gallows
        * This changes Stalkway to “Gallows Claw”
        * * As far as we know this change is only aesthetic
  * Gallows 
  * * Deals more damage from the Rear
    * Buffs your next Gibbet
    * * Gallows will  give you a buff called “Gibbet Effect Up”
      * * This last for 60s and wears of on your next Gibbet
        * This changes Stalkway to “Gibbet Claw”
        * * As far as we know this change is only aesthetic
  * Guillotine
  * * Deals AoE damage (conal damage)
  * They all generate 10 Shroud

This isn’t the only way we can generate Shroud though, to do so we have to use one ability first and build up another resource. Here is how it happens:

* You cast your ability Arcane Circle, this does three things:

  * Buffs your parties damage by 3%.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IaOMQImfEw3howQ5JOu0u87Wvmyj2EZcj6XDNDoXU5m1soJG8_ptDN2_DCG_rgzQpDUAGQutAHKj2LhrWGT2CbpyflEHkeyXPZcXdGRA-t5hlXI_X1vwpgajlBEtKFxupzlCVuGD=s0)

    * Lasts for 20s
  * Gives you and your party “Ceremony Circle” buff:![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q28c0ps1JJZVzF8B7qtRVr5cDR468aZ6CCCApNrpg5KAnzGWEZAza3yzFB4IJ6UsOCoqzUPnBpOVYyr4s20zlmn33ECQoOfFDKS7fi8LJG4RLFln-yBdMmLUoNpfCnrqawJNLBlf=s0)

    * Lasts for 5s
  * Grants you(the Reaper) a Sacrifice stack upon execution of a weapon skill

    * Goes away after a weapon skill is used.
  * Gives you the “Death’s Ceremony” buff:![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O-T3E-KwmdF6YZN0O6cfGi_TlISeE9ptF7CSQnQkzYTpOSuNkYQbrk8j1SUt0qcXGhl22IIzngAuCDHmKL32wE2k1NHktg1RziP6e6jrLeIBWTiwqfJdX27RxFT-hvqVaztxKLPQ=s0)

    * Lasts for 6s
  * Allows you to receive Sacrifice stacks from party members with the Ceremony Circle buff.
  * You generate Sacrifice stacks:![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Sw-GOnSq6h10qLFJu4FVsPCHpexG-fxgKoeyeLzIBMSrfSxetqqtCKKcvRtTKYJdPj1fLfp1_y9yxCJdO-OtQ29v-V3v8aLlGYWkqTrTRrFseEXFyRoHMfWY50mIJJ9Zr3hYMd2W=s0)

    * You can get a total of 8 Sacrifice stacks
    * The stacks last 30s or until spent
  * You spend Sacrifice stacks to use Plentiful Harvest:

    * You cannot use Plentiful Harvest until the  Death’s Ceremony buff wears off of you.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0S8X7TAlQvYQnPSue9WSXtBVnVFqvdYd2fKz9whPeLscR-2swyPduZ73t1Pld7ZRtkMETy4PfOMd3NZ9J0WLMlcL6cXTg3Dr9y92dScgcN7Smn3ho-WfM-AekxnUnX6w6qcTinQl=s0)
    * This means you only get ONE Plentiful Harvest each time you cast Arcane Circle
    * Deals AoE line damage
    * Does more potency with more stacks
    * Generates 50 Shroud

You are finally shrouded in darkness, surely this is the last spender. Well no, you use Shroud to gain access to your final form of building and spending. Here is what you can spend Shroud on:

* Lemure’s Shroud

  * Requires 50 Shroud
  * Gives you the buff “Lemure Shroud” for 30 secs
  * Gives you 5 stacks of “Lemure’s Soul”
  * Shroud will wear off in 30 secs or when you use all 5 stacks of Lemure’s Soul
  * Locks access to most weapon skills and abilities.
  * I will list what “additional abilities” can be used during shroud below
  * Changes / upgrades the following weapon skills:

    * Gibbet → Void Reaper
    * Gallows → Cross Reaper
    * Guillotine → ???
  * Changes / upgrades the following abilities:

    * Stalksway/Gibbet Claw/Gallows Claw → Lemure Slice
    * Thiefsway → ??? (Lemure Scythe if we had to guess)
  * Gives access to the following abilities:

    * Communio

Ok that was a lot, let’s unpack that and talk about what you do in Lemure’s Shroud. It is very simple once you see how it works:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FE-hiiWS5qcWRiNiWytCqNWmzmG_QMN_rlI8vKzv2rEyCmaqteAG9IcjU5V2Gww1kgAUVUufDx1JJbsYQEjynXXY1A1G0ykl_5iRSuqF_OnFN7jyUv_-hcqwFL9VJ5Xin7rZny8Y=s0)

* Using the weapon skills Void Reaper, Cross Reaper or Guillotines Transformation consume one Lemure Soul stack and give you one stack of Lemure X
* * Lemure Souls are the blue orbs in the gauge above
  * Void Reaper and Cross Reaper seem to have a 1.5s global cooldown, meaning they will be much faster than all of your other weapon skills.
  * We are unsure if Void Reaper and Cross Reaper will have positional requirements, but we believe they may.
  * Just like Gibbet and Gallows, using one will buff the other, so you will alternate. It doesn’t matter which one you start on.
* You spend 2 stacks of Lemure X on Lemure Slice or Lemure Scythe

  * Lemure X are the purple orbs in the gauge above.
* You use your last Lemure Soul to cast a finisher called Communio: 

  * Communio requires one Lemure Soul
  * Communio ends the Lemure Shroud status
  * Communio has a cast time of 1.3s
  * Communio has a base global cooldown of 2.5, like your other abilities





So your Lemure Shroud will look like this in single target:

Void Reaper → Cross Reaper → Lemure Slice → Void Reaper → Cross Reaper → Lemure Slice → Communio

And that is it! You have spent your last builder. That is Reaper in a nutshell! There are a few more interesting things to talk about though, so hang around!

**Shadow of Death / Whorl of Death(AoE)**

* These abilities apply a 30s debuff to enemies that increase your damage done to them by 10%
* * This only applies to your damage and not anyone else in your party
* This debuff can stack up to 60s
* If the target dies with the debuff, you will gain 10 Soul Gauge
* It apparently can be used during Lemure’s Shroud

**Hell’s Egress and Hell’s Ingress**

* These abilities share a cooldown
* Both leave a portal where you start
* Can be used during Lemure’s Shroud
* Egress teleports you back
* Ingress teleports you forward
* They both grant you the buff “Enhanced Harpe” for 15s.
* The ability you didn’t click changes to a portal icon
* * Clicking portal icon will teleport you back to your previous location
  * You have 10s to do this before it wears off

**Harpe**

* Ranged attack with a 1.3s cast time
* Instant if used with “Enhanced Harpe”
* Can be used during Lemure’s Shroud

**Soul Sow**

* Applies a permanent buff to you![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LLaoeLlhkziP9NrjrfMlqB0v281SeXCcLBksuGDVX2hQA8Z19btlcB9swnr3sj5atHbbCIhIqq1LvwISQ4Q1xw2RdFshB_88BWfNktc8Y_kM9zj3tdH7xtRtuqNJ4wGUHKHfeWB-=s0)
* Instant while out of combat
* 5s cast time during combat

**Harvest Moon**

* Consumes Soul Sow
* Weapon skill that is instant and ranged
* Decently strong ability
* Will be used once during a fight since you can precast it
* Can be used again in fights with long transitions that allow you to cast for 5s without losing uptime.

**Arcane Crest**

* Shield for 10% of your max health for 5s
* If shield is popped, gives you and all party members a regen for 15s
* 30s recast

Other usable abilities in Lemure’s Shroud:

* This is based on what we saw on the LL, subject to change
* Shadow/Whorl of Death
* Ingress and Egress
* Harpe
* Harvest Moon
* Soul Sow
* Arcane Crest and Circle
* Cross-Class Abilities
* Sprint

So in short to play Reaper you do the following:

* Maintain your Shadow of Death debuff
* Gain Soul Gauge
* Spend Soul Gauge to gain Sickles
* Spend Sickles to gain Shroud
* Spend Shroud to enter Lemure’s Shroud

Lastly, there are still a few questions we have that need to be answered in order for us to get a full picture of all that Reaper has to offer:

* Can Gluttony allow you to stack up to 3 Sickles.
* * The test would be to use Stalksway or any of the claws then follow up with Gluttony and see if you have 3 Sickles
* What is the damage delay on Harpe.
* * We are looking to see if it has a 1s~ish damage delay that would allow for pre pull Harpe without much damage loss
* Potencies and tooltips on the four abilities that change when you click Lemure’s Shadow
* * We are looking for potencies and positional requirements
* EN Names of the abilities
* Can you actually use Shadow of Death during Lemure’s Shroud when EW goes live, or during the Media Tour?
* What else can you use during Lemure’s Shroud, oGCDs and potions etc
* Tooltip for Shadow of Death
* Tooltip for Gallow Claw
* List of traits and their tooltips
* Animation delay on Egress abilities
* NA tooltips for every ability would honestly be appreciated
