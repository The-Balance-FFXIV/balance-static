  - question: Which Potion/Food should RPR use?
    answer: The highest available Strength potion. Currently, that is **Grade 4
      Gemdraught of Strength**. Current food is **Caramel Popcorn.** Always use
      High Quality!
  - question: Why is my Plentiful Harvest clipping in the AC 3rd GCD Opener?
    answer: Plentiful Harvest cannot be used for 6.7s after using Arcane Circle. You
      must early weave it or it will cause a clip if used where it is in the
      openers. The only way to avoid clipping if you do not early weave Arcane
      Circle is for Plentiful Harvest, and therefore your burst, to be delayed
      one additional GCD. Both clipping and delaying are worse than early
      weaving Arcane Circle. It will still clip at GCD speeds of 2.47 and
      faster. If you're entirely sure that youre pressing Arcane Cirlce as soon
      as possible, and do not have a GCD speed of 2.47 or faster, then it could
      be a ping related issue.
  - question: How do we properly use Harvest Moon/Harpe?
    answer: Harpe should be used prepull in the opener and when you are forced out
      of melee range for at least one GCD, provided it is not possible to keep
      your melee GCDs rolling. Harvest Moon should always be used for this
      instead, if it is available. Otherwise, Harvest Moon should be used for
      AoE, if applicable, or used in place of a weaker GCD for an overall
      potency gain. Harvest Moon uses will very much be a fight-specific
      optimization and there is no "this is always the best way to use it."
      Perfectio can also be used as a disengage tool in place of Harpe, please
      see the Intermediate Guide for more details.
  - question: Why do we precast Harpe instead of using Harvest Moon or just running
      in and immediately doing Shadow of Death?
    answer: Using a casted ability before the countdown is finished does two things.
      1. It starts your GCD clock early without early pulling. 2. The damage
      doesn't go out until the cast is finished which means the damage does not
      land until the countdown reaches 0. Pulling with other actions, such as
      Harvest Moon, Shadow of Death and Soul Slice is an optimization technique
      called "Harpe sacrifice" and it's categorized as non-standard since you
      need to pay attention to finer details when doing those. Some fight
      specific optimizations do exist where just skipping the precast Harpe
      without all the extra care that non-standard asks will gain you a stronger
      GCD in the phase due to fight phasing or killtime. Consult fight-specific
      resources for more information.
  - question: When should we refresh Death's Design?/How often should we use Shadow
      of Death?
    answer: Use Shadow of Death before Death's Design falls off, or as needed for
      filler for even-minute burst windows. See the Intermediate Guide for more
      info on even-minute burst windows.
  - question: What is the difference between Blood Stalk, Unveiled Gibbet, and
      Unveiled Gallows?
    answer: Nothing functionally. They are effectively the same things with
      different animations. They each consume 50 Soul to give one stack of Soul
      Reaver. Blood Stalk is 80 potency less than the Unveiled forms, but you
      will never use the base form unless you drop the Enhanced Gallows/Gibbet
      buff (aside from once in the opener if you have not unlocked Gluttony
      yet).
  - question: Why don't we fit three Communios in potion instead of only two?
    answer: Triple Enshroud windows do exist, but they are non-stndard gameplay, due
      to their inconsistent nature and the fact that they require heavy planning
      to be performed.
  - question: Does it matter if we start Enshroud with Void Reaping or Cross Reaping?
    answer: No. They don't have positionals and the first hit is always unbuffed by
      Enhanced Void/Cross Reaping, so you are free to use whichever. The
      important thing is that you alternate them to keep them buffed by Enhanced
      Void/Cross Reaping.
  - question: Why do we weave Arcane Circle after a Shadow of Death and not after a
      Void/Cross Reaping in the Death Design Retain Double Enshroud?
    answer: Bloodsown Circle forces a 6.7s delay between when we use Arcane Circle
      and Plentiful Harvest. Because Void/Cross Reaping has a shorter recast
      than Shadow of Death, there is less time between Arcane Circle and
      Plentiful Harvest. This ~1 second difference is enough to cause a clip
      between where the GCD clock is ready and Plentiful Harvest can actually be
      used.
  - question: When should I use a Potion?
    answer: This is a fight-specific decision. If a fight allows for it and it
      doesn't cause a lost usage, the opener potion can be moved to the 2:XX
      burst window for more potency in the buff. Different party buff timings
      due to mechanics or party choice can alter this. See ⁠#rpr_encounter in
      the Discord for potion timings for each specific fight.
  - question: How much Skill Speed does Reaper want and why?
    answer: The short answer is that RPR wants a 2.49 GCD speed for standard play.
      It minimizes our drift from Arcane Circle due to alignment while keeping
      Skill Speed investment low. There is a much longer, more in depth answer,
      but it requires non-standard knowledge.
  - question: What is gauge-negativity and how does it affect us?
    answer: '"Gauge-negativity" refers to the fact that we *usually* have less gauge
      in an even minute burst than the last. Right now, RPR "loses" 20 Soul
      every 2mins. Since we generate 60 Soul and 50 Shroud before the first
      Double Enshroud window, we have a breakpoint at the 10mins in an full
      uptime encounter. Options for dealing with are either deadzoning the
      sequence between 8:XX and 10:XX burst windows or doing Single Shroud
      windows from 10:XX and onwards. This decision will depend on the fight
      that happens to suffer from this characteristic of our rotation.
      **Realistically, this is no big deal.** "Usually" here refers to the fact
      that "gauge-negativity" can be generalized to the "gauge balance" concept
      from non-standard gameplay and which is explained in the Advanced Guide.'
  - question: How do Arcane Circle, Immortal Sacrifice, and Plentiful Harvest work?
    answer: >-
      Using Arcane Circle gives three buffs: Arcane Circle, Circle of Sacrifice,
      and Bloodsown Circle. 


      **Arcane Circle** is a 3% damage up buff for 20s that is applied to all party members within 30y of the caster. 


      **Circle of Sacrifice** is a 5s buff applied to the entire party. It gives the RPR that cast it one stack of **Immortal Sacrifice** when the affected player (including the RPR, meaning we can have up to 8 stacks) uses a skill that satisfies the following criteria: 1. is a weaponskill or spell and 2. does damage/applied a negative effect. From the first criteria, NIN's Mmudras do not count. From the second, DNC steps, PCT canvases, and healing GCD spells are also excluded. 


      **Bloodsown Circle** lasts 6.7s and blocks Plentiful Harvest from being used for the duration. 


      **Plentiful Harvest** consumes all Immortal Sacrifice stacks and gains 40 potency for every additional stack, starting at 720 and maxing out at 1000 potency at eight stacks. Your own stack is already included in the base potency of 720, as it is required to even use the skill. 


      Simply put: Arcane Circle gives a +3% damage buff for 20s. It also gives one stack of Immortal Sacrifice for every party member (including yourself) that lands a weaponskill/spell in the first 5s of Arane Circle's duration. Immortal Sacrifice stacks allow the use of Plentiful Harvest, and increase the potency of Plentiful Harvest by 40 per stack, up to 1000 potency at eight stacks. Plentiful Harvest cannot be used until Bloodsown Circle expires, which happens 6.7s after using Arcane Circle.
  - question: How do you tell which player did not give you an Immortal Sacrifice Stack?
    answer: >-
      Follow this method to be certain. Replays/Streams can be used as well but
      require more guesswork.


      1. You or someone in your group will need to upload the fight in question to FFLogs

      2. Click on the "Buffs" tab

      3. Select Circle of Sacrifice from the "All Abilities" dropdown box

      4. Select the "Events" tab

      5. Look for any time Circle of Sacrifice lasted the full 5.0s duration. If the buff lasted *less* than 5.0s, that person gave you a stack. If it lasted the full duration, they did not give a stack.
  - question: Why are some bursts being referred to as numbers and letters?
    answer: The nomenclature system you might be seeing around is called
      "non-standard notation". When out of the standard rotation bubble, RPR has
      an enormous variety of possible bursts and the nomenclature help us to
      track some characteristics for each window. The classification system will
      be found in the Advanced Guide when it is finished.
  - answer: "A full non-standard guide, the Advanced Guide, is currently a work in
      progress. Writing this guide requires a significant amount of time and the
      author is very limited in time due to real-life university commitments.
      Please be patient as the guide is being written. In the interim if you
      want to know more about non-standard, get in touch with @caron.tt in ⁠the
      #rpr_questions channel of our [Discord
      server](https://discord.gg/thebalanceffxiv)﻿."
    question: Several FAQs mention "non-standard gameplay." Where can I learn more
      about this?
