### Potion Optimization

Ideally we would rather potion at the 2nd minute mark, but this isn't always the case in some encounters. There are actually three ways to optimize potion, each with different effectiveness.

* Triple weave Potion after Arcane Circle, before Gluttony.

  * This require immaculate ping and potentially the aid of third party software, the gains here are minor but it is our best usage.
* In a low raid buff situation (1 additional raid buffer other than you) we can alter the opener slightly:

  * Move the second Shadow of Death to after the First Soul Slice
  * Late Weave AC after the Soul Slice
  * Double Weave Potion and Gluttony after the new Second Shadow of Death positioning.
* Lastly, you can execute it like the image is above with very little impact on our overall DPS.



### High Ping / SKS Optimization

If you are playing at below a 2.47 GCD or have high ping, you can move the the Soul Slice after Perfection to before Plentiful Harvest. This will allow for ease of use and come at minor to almost no potency loss depending on external raid buffs.
