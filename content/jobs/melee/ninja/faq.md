  - question: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
    answer: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our
      rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a
      higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority. If you
      want to know more about the math behind stats and stat tiering, go to the
      sub stats tier list linked [here](http://bit.ly/substats).
  - question: How much ping do I need to double-weave?
    answer: The threshold is about 40ms.
  - question: "What do I do in multiple target scenarios? "
    answer: Use Doton on 2+ targets, if targets remain in Doton for full duration.
      Death Blossom and Hakke should be used on 3+ targets, ideally within
      Doton. Hellfrog only used on 3+ targets. Katon and Goka Mekkyaku on 3+
      targets, also ideally in Doton.
  - question: "What should I use to disengage from the boss? "
    answer: "Priority order: \r

      1. If the disengage is within 20s of Trick use Suiton. \r

      2. Phantom Kamaitachi\r

      3. Raiton \r

      4. Throwing Dagger"
  - question: Should I always weave Trick late?
    answer: "Only purposefully weave Trick late in the opener. Anywhere else, use on
      cooldown. "
  - question: Should I save Bunshin for Trick, or use it on cooldown?
    answer: Use on cooldown.
  - question: What if my cooldowns misalign from Trick Attack?
    answer: "In the event cooldowns become permanently misaligned from Trick, it is
      better to continue using them off-cooldown rather than realign and risk
      losing a usage. "
  - question: "Should I use Phantom Kamaitachi immediately or save it for Trick Attack? "
    answer: "First priority of Phantom Kamaitachi is to use it as a disengagement
      tool over Raiton or Throwing Dagger. If there is none, you generally can
      save it for the next Trick window. Some important things to keep in mind:

      \r

      **1. Odd Trick Windows (no-TCJ):** Most of the time prefer
      Phantom.\ 

      \r

      **2. Even/2m Trick Windows (with TCJ):** Generally, you do not want
      Phantom in 2m windows."
  - question: "Should I be using Forked Raiju or Fleeting Raiju? "
    answer: Both Forked Raiju and Fleeting Raiju have an identical potency of 560.
      Forked Raiju is a gap-closer, whereas Fleeting Raiju is a standard melee
      GCD which allows it freedom of movement. Realistically you should always
      be using Fleeting Raiju, however if you need to use a gap-closer then use
      Forked Raiju. Tldr; use whatever you want.
  - question: "Why don’t we use Huraijin anywhere in the rotation? "
    answer: "Huraijin is more of a recovery tool than a damage skill, as it is a DPS
      loss if used over Armor Crush. It’s primarily used to gain full Huton
      gauge after a death, after a long fight transition, or if the boss is
      pulled before you get to cast Huton pre-pull. "
  - question: Does Kassatsu's % damage affect Hyosho and Goka?
    answer: Yes it does.
  - question: Do uncombo-ed skills give Ninki?
    answer: No, they don't.
  - question: " Does Hakke give Huton/Ninki without hitting a target?"
    answer: No, It doesn't
  - question: Is there a dungeon/normal mode/24man/non-savage BiS?
    answer: No, it wouldn't be BiS.﻿

Frequently Asked Questions: 

> *Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?*

A: Yes, the main ones use either <t> to go to your target at the time, or use <1>,<2>,<3>, etc to go to specific party members.

> *Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?*

A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority. If you want to know more about the math behind stats and stat tiering, go to the sub stats tier list linked [here](http://bit.ly/substats).

> *Q: Does Kassatsu  % damage affect Hyosho and Goka?*

A: Yes it does.

> *Q: Do uncombo-ed skills give Ninki?*

A: No, they don't.

> *Q: Does Hakke give Huton/Ninki without hitting a target?*

A: No, It doesn't

> *Q: Is high ping a bad thing?*

A: Yes, but ever since the mini rework of ninja in 5.1 it has become much less impactful, though it still is a bad thing at high end of ping because NIN are still one of if not the job with the highest casts per minute at optimal play.

> *Q: How much ping is too high ping?*

A: As much as you can tolerate, there is no set amount.

> *Q: Is there an opener with no double weaves?*

A: Not with everything in it, but you can move mug to the oGCD slot where potion is if you aren't going to use a potion.

> *Q: Is it galaxy brain to macro Dream Within a Dream and Assassinate together?*

A: No, macroing skills together is bad, especially since they will not always be used at the same time, and because with how macros work, this would delay your next GCD every time.

> *Q: Should I use Kassatsu on Doton?*

A: After lvl 76, replace a normal Ninjutsu with Doton and use Kassatsu for Goka if you need to aoe. Before lvl 76 use Kassatsu on Doton over Katon.

> *Q: What do I do in multiple target scenarios?*

A: Two targets use AE/AC combo to either equally lower them or focus on one.
For three targets or more Death Blossom+Hakke Mujinsatsu combo.

> *Q: When do I Katon/Doton?*

A: In a two or more targets situation, use Doton if the targets are going to live long enough and will stay inside the Doton. Use Katon/Goka as a filler.

> *Q: Is there a dungeon/normal mode/24man/non-savage BIS?*

A: No, it wouldn't be BiS.

> *Q: Should I save Bunshin for Trick, or use it on cooldown?*

A: Use it on cooldown.
