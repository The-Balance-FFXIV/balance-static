If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of our combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 380, 440 if done from the rear of the enemy. Grants 15 Ninki if used in combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.

![ArmorCrush](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002915_hr1.png)\
**Armor Crush**  

Delivers an attack with a potency of 140, 200 if done from the flank of the enemy. If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 360, 420 if done from the flank of the enemy. If done as part of the combo, it will also add 30 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already active, to a maximum of 60 seconds. Grants 15 Ninki if used in combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.

![ThrowingDagger](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000614_hr1.png)\
**Throwing Dagger**

Delivers a ranged attack with a potency of 120. The range for this GCD is 20 yalms. Grants 5 Ninki.

![DeathBlossom](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000615_hr1.png)\
**Death Blossom**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies. This is an Area of Effect (AoE) ability and deals damage in a five yalm radius around you. This is the first part of our AoE combo. Grants 5 Ninki.

![HakkeMujinsatsu](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002923_hr1.png)\
**Hakke Mujinsatsu**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies. If done as the second part of our AoE combo, it instead delivers an attack with a potency of 130 to all nearby enemies, and adds 10 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already active, to a maximum of 60 seconds. Just like Death Blossom, this is an AoE attack that deals damage in a five yalm radius around you. Grants 5 Ninki if used in combo.

**Phantom Kamaitachi**

Orders your shadow to deliver an attack with a potency of 600 to target, and 50% less to all remaining enemies. Additionally, it also adds 10 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already active, to a maximum of 60 seconds. Increases Ninki gauge by 10. This GCD can only be used under the effect of Phantom Kamaitachi Ready, granted by Bunshin, and consumes the buff when used. Using this skill while Bunshin is still active does not consume a stack, nor does it gain extra damage or ninki. This action cannot be assigned to the hotbar, and replaces Bunshin while the Phantom Kamiatachi Ready buff is active. Has a range of 20 yalms.

Damage from Phantom Kamaitachi counts as 'Pet' damage, and is thus roughly 2% less potency than stated.

**Hollow Nozuchi**

Automatically deals earth damage with a potency of 50 to all enemies within an active Doton upon the execution of Katon, Goka Mekkyaku, Phantom Kamaitachi, or upon the execution of Hakke Mujinsatsu as a combo action after Death Blossom. This action cannot be assigned to the hotbar.

**Fleeting Raiju**

Delivers a lightning attack with a potency of 560. Grants 5 ninki. Can only be used while under the effect of Raiju Ready, granted by Raiton, and consumes 1 stack of the buff when used. Fleeting Raiju is a regular melee GCD. 

# Ninjutsus/Mudras (GCDs)

Ninjutsu set off a global cooldown of 1.5 seconds upon use, not reducible by Huton or skill speed, and each use of a ninjutsu will use up one nunjutsu charge. Mudras have a shared  two charges, a charge time of 20 seconds per charge, and can only be started when a normal GCD could be started. Instead of a 2.5 or 1.5 second global cooldown, the mudras themselves only give a .5 second global cooldown. Using the first mudra will instantly consume a ninjutsu charge and grant a six second buff. If a ninjutsu is not executed within these six seconds, the charge is lost. Inputting two of the same mudra in a combination, or using any other action while the buff is active (including sprint, food, tinctures, role actions, LB etc) will result in a Rabbit Medium, or 'Bunny'.

![Doton](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002911_hr1.png)\
**Doton**  

Creates a patch of corrupted earth that acts like a stationary DoT that does 80 potency to enemies who are in it when it ticks for damage and 80 potency to anyone in the AoE as it is created. Also applies a 40% heavy on enemies in this AoE. This lasts for 18 seconds, resulting in 480 potency over all the ticks, to a combined potency of 560 altogether. This is achieved by any three-mudra combination ending in Chi. So, Ten>Jin>Chi or Jin>Ten>Chi. The AoE has a radius of five yalms.

**Rabbit Medium ('Bunny')**

This ninjutsu does no damage, and has no effect aside from spawning a small rabbit on the head of the player. It  still triggers the 1.5s recast like all other Ninjutsu.

# Regular Abilities (oGCDs)

These are your regular abilities that can be used at any time when you are not in an animation lock, even while the global cooldown from a GCD is ongoing.

Delivers an attack with a potency of 150. Grants 40 Ninki gauge on use.

Also increases the chance of additional items being dropped by target if mug is dealt before, or as, the finishing blow. This extra thing is mostly irrelevant since it only works on basic drops that you don't end up caring about, like Bat Fangs. This skill has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds.

This buff allows you to use Hyosho Ranryu and Goka Mekkyaku. The damage buff does also apply to Goka Mekkyaku and Hyosho Ranryu. This buff has a duration of 15 seconds and is lost upon the use of the next ninjutsu or the timer running out. This ability has a personal cooldown of 60 seconds.

This effect has a duration of six seconds. In essence, this allows you to use one one-step ninjutsu, one two-step ninjutsu, and one three-step ninjutsu in a row. Common uses are Fuma>Raiton>Suiton, Fuma>Katon>Doton, and Fuma>Katon>Suiton. Using Raiton under TCJ will still grant Raiju Ready as normal. This ability has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds.
