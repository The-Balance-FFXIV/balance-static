# Weaponskills (Commonly referred to as GCDs)

![SpinningEdge](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000601_hr1.png)\
**Spinning Edge**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 220. Grants 5 Ninki. This is the first part of our basic combo. 

![GustSlash](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000602_hr1.png)\
**Gust Slash**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 160. If used after Spinning Edge in the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 320. Grants 5 Ninki if used in the combo. This is the second part of our basic combo.

![AeolianEdge](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000605_hr1.png)\
**Aeolian Edge**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 140, or 200 potency if done from the rear of the enemy. If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of our combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 380, or 440 if done from the enemy's rear. Grants 15 Ninki if used in the combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.

![ArmorCrush](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002915_hr1.png)\
**Armor Crush**  

Delivers an attack with a potency of 140, or 200 if done from the enemy's flank. If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 360, or 420 if done from the enemy's flank. If done as part of the combo, it will also add 30 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already active, to a maximum of 60 seconds. Grants 15 Ninki if used in the combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.

![ThrowingDagger](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000614_hr1.png)\
**Throwing Dagger**

Delivers a ranged attack with a potency of 120. The range for this GCD is 20 yalms. Grants 5 Ninki.

![DeathBlossom](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000615_hr1.png)\
**Death Blossom**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies. This Area of Effect (AoE) ability deals damage in a five-yalm radius around you. This is the first part of our AoE combo. Grants 5 Ninki.

![HakkeMujinsatsu](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002923_hr1.png)\
**Hakke Mujinsatsu**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies. If done as the second part of our AoE combo, it instead delivers an attack with a potency of 130 to all nearby enemies and adds 10 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already active, to a maximum of 60 seconds. Just like Death Blossom, this an AoE attack deals damage in a five-yalm radius around you. Grants 5 Ninki if used in the combo.

![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002929_hr1.png)

**Phantom Kamaitachi**

Orders your shadow to deliver an attack with a potency of 600 to the target, and 50% less to all remaining enemies. Additionally, it also adds 10 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already active, to a maximum of 60 seconds. Increases Ninki gauge by 10. This GCD can only be used under the effect of Phantom Kamaitachi Ready, granted by Bunshin, and consumes the buff when used. Using this skill while Bunshin is still active neither consumes a stack nor gains extra damage or Ninki. This action cannot be assigned to the hotbar and replaces Bunshin while the Phantom Kamiatachi Ready buff is active. It has a range of 20 yalms.

Damage from Phantom Kamaitachi counts as pet damage, so it is roughly 2% less potency than stated.

**Hollow Nozuchi**

Upon the execution of Katon, Goka Mekkyaku, Phantom Kamaitachi—or Hakke Mujinsatsu as a combo action after Death Blossom—it automatically deals earth damage with a potency of 50 to all enemies within an active Doton. This action cannot be assigned to the hotbar.

![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002931_hr1.png)

**Forked Raiju**

Delivers a lightning attack with a potency of 560. Grants 5 Ninki. Can only be used while under the effect of Raiju Ready, granted by Raiton, and consumes one stack of the buff when used. Forked Raiju is a gap-closer with a range of 20 yalms. 

 ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002932_hr1.png)

**Fleeting Raiju**

Delivers a lightning attack with a potency of 560. Grants 5 Ninki. Can only be used while under the effect of Raiju Ready, granted by Raiton, and consumes one stack of the buff when used. Fleeting Raiju is a regular melee GCD. 

# Ninjutsus/Mudras (GCDs)

Ninjutsu sets off a global cooldown of 1.5 seconds upon use, not reducible by Huton or skill speed, and each use of a Ninjutsu will use up one Ninjutsu charge. Mudras have a shared two charges, a charge time of 20 seconds per charge, and can only be started when a normal GCD could be started. Instead of a 2.5 or 1.5 second GCD, the mudras themselves only give a 0.5 second GCD. Using the first mudra will instantly consume a Ninjutsu charge and grant a six-second buff. If a Ninjutsu is not executed within these six seconds then the charge is lost. Inputting two of the same mudra in a combination, or using any other action while the buff is active (including Sprint, food, tinctures, role actions, Limit Break, etc.) will result in a Rabbit Medium, or "Bunny."

![Ten](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002901_hr1.png)\
**Ten**

Make the ritual mudra hand gesture for “heaven.”

![Chi](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002902_hr1.png)\
**Chi**

Make the ritual mudra hand gesture for “earth.”

![Jin](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002903_hr1.png)\
**Jin**

Make the ritual mudra hand gesture for “man.”

![FumaShuriken](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002907_hr1.png)\
**Fuma Shuriken**

Delivers a ranged Ninjutsu attack with a potency of 450. This is achieved with any single mudra use. Has a range of 25 yalms.

![Raiton](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002912_hr1.png)\
**Raiton**

Deals lightning damage with a potency of 650 and grants a stack of Raiju Ready, up to a maximum of three. This is achieved by any two-mudra combination that ends with Chi. So, Ten > Chi or Jin > Chi. Has a range of 20 yalms. 

![Katon](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002908_hr1.png)\
**Katon**

Deals fire damage with a potency of 350 to the target and all nearby enemies within a five-yalm radius. This is achieved by any two-mudra combination that ends with Ten, such as Chi > Ten or Jin > Ten. Has a range of 20 yalms. 

![Hyoton](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002909_hr1.png)\
**Hyoton**

![Huton](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002910_hr1.png)\
**Huton**

Reduces weaponskill recast time and auto-attack delay by 15%. Starts with a duration of 60 seconds and can be increased incrementally back to the maximum of 60 seconds from Armor Crush and Hakke Mujinsatsu. This is achieved by any three-mudra combination ending in Ten, such as Jin > Chi > Ten or Chi > Jin > Ten. The buff is only applied to yourself. It can also be obtained by using Huraijin.

![Doton](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002911_hr1.png)\
**Doton**  

Creates a patch of corrupted earth that acts like a stationary Damage over Time (DoT) and deals 80 potency to enemies within it, as well as 80 potency to any enemies in the AoE as it is created. Also applies a 40% heavy on enemies in the AoE which lasts for 18 seconds, resulting in 480 total potency, and a combined potency of 560 altogether. This is achieved by any three-mudra combination ending in Chi, such as Ten > Jin > Chi or Jin > Ten > Chi. The AoE has a radius of five yalms.

![Suiton](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002913_hr1.png)\
**Suiton**

Deals water damage with a potency of 500. This also grants the effect of Suiton for 20 seconds, which allows you to use any ability that was previously only usable under Hidden, such as Trick Attack. This is achieved by any three-mudra combination that ends with Jin: Ten > Chi > Jin or Chi > Ten > Jin. Has a range of 20 yalms.

This is achieved by any two-mudra combination that ends with Ten, such as Chi > Ten or Jin > Ten. Has a range of 20 yalms. In addition, this is only usable under the effects of Kassatsu and is a replacement for Katon when under the effects of Kassatsu. Because of the boost from Kassatsu, the true potency is 780.

![HyoshoRanryu](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002926_hr1.png)\
**Hyosho Ranryu**

Deals ice damage with a potency of 1300. This is achieved with any two-mudra combination that ends with Jin. So, Ten > Jin or Chi > Jin. Has a range of 25 yalms. In addition, this is only usable under the effects of Kassatsu and is a replacement for Hyoton. Because of the boost from Kassatsu, the true potency is 1690.

![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002914_hr1.png)

**Rabbit Medium ("Bunny")**

This Ninjutsu does no damage and has no effect aside from spawning a small rabbit on the player's head. It still triggers the 1.5 second recast like all other Ninjutsu.

# Regular Abilities (oGCDs)

These are your regular abilities that can be used at any time when you are not in an animation lock, even while the global cooldown from a GCD is ongoing.

![Mug](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000613_hr1.png)\
**Mug**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 150. Grants 40 Ninki gauge on use. In addition, it debuffs the enemy for 20 seconds with a Vulnerability Up, increasing the enemy’s damage taken by 5% from all sources during this time. It also increases the chance of additional items dropped by the target if Mug is dealt before or as the finishing blow. This extra effect is mostly irrelevant since it only works on basic drops that you don't end up caring about, such as Bat Fangs. This skill has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds. 

![TrickAttack](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000618_hr1.png)\
**Trick Attack**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 300, or 400 if done from the target enemy's rear. It also applies a Vulnerability Up debuff to the enemy for 15 seconds, increasing the enemy’s damage taken from you alone by 10%. This can only be used under the effect Hidden. (See Suiton for how to use this in combat). This ability has a personal cooldown of 60 seconds.

![Kassatsu](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002906_hr1.png)\
**Kassatsu**

Allows the use of a single Ninjutsu without consuming a mudra charge. In addition, it increases the damage of the Ninjutsu used during this buff by 30%. This buff allows you to use Hyosho Ranryu and Goka Mekkyaku. The damage buff also applies to Goka Mekkyaku and Hyosho Ranryu. This buff has a duration of 15 seconds and is lost upon the use of the next ninjutsu or the timer running out. This ability has a personal cooldown of 60 seconds. 

![DreamWithinADream](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002918_hr1.png)\
**Dream Within A Dream**

Delivers a three-hit attack, with each attack hitting for 150 potency for a total of 450 potency. This ability has a personal cooldown of 60 seconds.

![TenChiJin](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002922_hr1.png)\
**Ten Chi Jin (TCJ)**

Temporarily converts each of the three mudra into a Ninjutsu action. Executing one of these actions will convert the remaining mudra into different Ninjutsu actions until either all three have been executed or the Ten Chi Jin effect expires. You can only use Ninjutsu during this, and the same Ninjutsu cannot be executed twice. This ability cannot be activated while under the effects of Kassatsu. This effect ends upon moving. This effect has a duration of six seconds. In essence, this allows you to use one one-step Ninjutsu, one two-step Ninjutsu, and one three-step Ninjutsu in a row. Common uses are Fuma > Raiton > Suiton, Fuma > Katon > Doton, and Fuma > Katon > Suiton. Using Raiton under TCJ will still grant Raiju Ready as normal. This ability has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds.

![Meisui](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002924_hr1.png)\
**Meisui**

Dispels the Suiton buff and in return increases the Ninki gauge by 50. Additionally, increases the potency of the next Bhavacakra from 300 to 500 if used within 30 seconds. This ability can only be used while in combat. This ability has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds.

# Ninki Abilities (oGCDs)

Ninki abilities are like normal oGCDs except that they require 50 Ninki to use. You can store up to 100 Ninki at once.

![HellfrogMedium](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002920_hr1.png)\
**Hellfrog Medium** 

Deals fire damage with a potency of 160 to the target and any other enemies near the target. Costs 50 Ninki to use. This ability has a range of 25 yalms and deals damage in a six-yalm radius around the target.

![Bunshin](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002927_hr1.png)\
**Bunshin**

Grants five stacks of the buff Bunshin. Each stack allows your shadow to attack enemies each time you execute a weaponskill. Additionally, grants the effect Phantom Kamaitachi Ready for 45 seconds. The shadow attack potency varies based on the attack executed, but is not affected by combo bonuses. Each attack from the shadow will grant you five Ninki for a total of 25 Ninki if all five stacks of Bunshin are used before the time limit. This buff has a duration of 30 seconds and costs 50 Ninki to use. This ability has a personal cooldown of 90 seconds.

Melee attack: 160 potency.
Ranged attack: 160 potency.
AoE attack: 80 potency to all enemies hit.

Damage from Bunshin counts as pet damage, so it is roughly 2% less potency than stated.

# Utility Abilities (oGCDs)

These are oGCDs which don’t deal damage, so they aren’t necessarily used on cooldown. Instead, they are used when specifically needed.

![ShadeShift](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000607_hr1.png)\
**Shade Shift**

Gives yourself a shield equal to 20% of your maximum HP. This shield lasts 20 seconds, or until it is destroyed. This ability has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds.

![Hide](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000609_hr1.png)\
**Hide**

Blend in with your surroundings, making it impossible for most enemies to detect you, but reducing movement speed by 50%. Has no effect on enemies ten levels higher than you, or certain enemies with special sight. Grants the buff Hidden. This cannot be executed in combat, and you will lose the Hidden buff and be taken out of Hide if you enter combat. This effect also ends upon the use of any action except for Sprint, or upon the reuse of Hide. The use of this ability will also restore two charges of your mudras.
