If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of our combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 400, or 460 if done from the enemy's rear. If you have at least one stack of Kazematoi, this attack will instead deliver an attack of 500, or 560 if done from the enemy's rear. Grants 15 Ninki if used in the combo.

**Armor Crush**  \

If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 440, or 500 if done from the enemy's flank. If done as part of the combo, it will also add 2 stacks to your Kazematoi gauge, to a maximum of 5 stacks. Grants 15 Ninki if used in the combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.

![ThrowingDagger](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000614_hr1.png)\
**Throwing Dagger**\
Delivers a ranged attack with a potency of 200. The range for this GCD is 20 yalms. Grants 5 Ninki.

**Phantom Kamaitachi**\
Orders your shadow to deliver an attack with a potency of 700 to the target and all nearby enemies. Increases Ninki gauge by 10. This GCD can only be used under the effect of Phantom Kamaitachi Ready, granted by Bunshin, and consumes the buff when used.

This action cannot be assigned to the hotbar and replaces Bunshin while the Phantom Kamiatachi Ready buff is active. It has a range of 20 yalms.

Damage from Phantom Kamaitachi counts as pet damage, so it is roughly 7% less potency than stated.

Upon the execution of Katon, Goka Mekkyaku, Phantom Kamaitachi—or Hakke Mujinsatsu as a combo action after Death Blossom—it automatically deals earth damage with a potency of 70 to all enemies within an active Doton. This action cannot be assigned to the hotbar.

# Ninjutsus/Mudras (GCDs)

Ninjutsu sets off a global cooldown of 1.5 seconds upon use, not reducible by Huton or skill speed, and each use of a Ninjutsu will use up one Ninjutsu charge. Mudras have a shared two charges, a charge time of 20 seconds per charge, and can only be started when a normal GCD could be started. Instead of a 2.5 or 1.5 second GCD, the mudras themselves only give a 0.5 second GCD. Using the first mudra will instantly consume a Ninjutsu charge and grant a six-second buff. If a Ninjutsu is not executed within these six seconds then the charge is lost. Inputting two of the same mudra in a combination, or using any other action while the buff is active (including Sprint, food, tinctures, role actions, Limit Break, etc.) will result in a Rabbit Medium, or "Bunny".

![Katon](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002908_hr1.png)\

**Doton**  \
Creates a patch of corrupted earth that acts like a stationary Damage over Time (DoT) and deals 80 potency to enemies within it, as well as 80 potency to any enemies in the AoE as it is created. Also applies a 40% heavy on enemies in the AoE which lasts for 18 seconds, resulting in 480 total potency, and a combined potency of 560 altogether. This is achieved by any three-mudra combination ending in Chi, such as Ten > Jin > Chi or Jin > Ten > Chi. The AoE has a radius of five yalms.

![Suiton](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002913_hr1.png)\

# Regular Abilities (oGCDs)

These are your regular abilities that can be used at any time when you are not in an animation lock, even while the global cooldown from a GCD is ongoing.

![Thumbnail for version as of 01:18, 28 June 2024](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/w/images/1/1d/Dokumori_Icon.png)\

Delivers an attack with a potency of 400 to all enemies in a eight-yalm cone before you. Grants 40 Ninki gauge on use. Grants Higi on use. In addition, it debuffs the enemy targets for 20 seconds with Dokumori, increasing the enemy’s damage taken by 5% from all sources during this time. It also increases the chance of additional items dropped by the target if Dokumori is dealt before or as the finishing blow. This extra effect is mostly irrelevant since it only works on basic drops that you don't end up caring about, such as Bat Fangs. This skill has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds. 

![Thumbnail for version as of 01:18, 28 June 2024](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/w/images/e/e4/Kunai%27s_Bane_Icon.png)\

It also applies the Kunai's Bane debuff to all targets for 15 seconds, increasing the enemy’s damage taken from you alone by 10%. This can only be used under the effect Hidden. (See Suiton for how to use this in combat). This ability has a personal cooldown of 60 seconds.

![Kassatsu](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002906_hr1.png)\
**Kassatsu**

Allows the use of a single Ninjutsu without consuming a mudra charge. In addition, it increases the damage of the Ninjutsu used during this buff by 30%. This buff allows you to use Hyosho Ranryu and Goka Mekkyaku. The damage buff also applies to Goka Mekkyaku and Hyosho Ranryu. This buff has a duration of 15 seconds and is lost upon the use of the next ninjutsu or the timer running out. This ability has a personal cooldown of 60 seconds. 

![DreamWithinADream](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002918_hr1.png)\

**Ten Chi Jin (TCJ)**\
Grants Tenri Jindo Ready. Temporarily converts each of the three mudra into a Ninjutsu action. Executing one of these actions will convert the remaining mudra into different Ninjutsu actions until either all three have been executed or the Ten Chi Jin effect expires. You can only use Ninjutsu during this, and the same Ninjutsu cannot be executed twice. This ability cannot be activated while under the effects of Kassatsu. This effect has a duration of six seconds. In essence, this allows you to use one one-step Ninjutsu, one two-step Ninjutsu, and one three-step Ninjutsu in a row. Common uses are Fuma > Raiton > Suiton, Fuma > Katon > Doton, and Fuma > Katon > Suiton. Using Raiton under TCJ will still grant Raiju Ready as normal.
