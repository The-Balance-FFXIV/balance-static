# Weaponskills (Commonly referred to as GCDs)

![SpinningEdge](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000601_hr1.png)  
**Spinning Edge**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 230. Grants 5 Ninki. This is the first part of our basic combo. 

![GustSlash](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000602_hr1.png)  
**Gust Slash**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100. If used after Spinning Edge in the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 340. Grants 5 Ninki if used in combo. This is the second part of our basic combo.

![AeolianEdge](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000605_hr1.png)  
**Aeolian Edge**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100, 160 potency if done from the rear of the enemy. If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of our combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 420, 480 if done from the rear of the enemy. Grants 10 Ninki if used in combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.

![ArmorCrush](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002915_hr1.png)  
**Armor Crush**  

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100, 160 if done from the flank of the enemy. If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 400, 460 if done from the flank of the enemy. If done as part of the combo, it will also add 30 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already going, to a maximum of 70 seconds. Grants 10 Ninki if used in combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.

![ShadowFang](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000606_hr1.png)  
**Shadow Fang**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 200. In addition, this will also put a damage over time effect (DoT) that lasts 30 seconds and deals a potency of 90 every tick, resulting in this ability having a total potency of 1100 when all of the DoT ticks are accounted for. Unlike other GCDs for ninja, this GCD has an extra personal cooldown of 70 seconds, though this is reduced by skill speed and Huton, which will make it have just under a 60 second cooldown once you have Huton up. Grants 10 Ninki.

![ThrowingDagger](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000614_hr1.png)  
**Throwing Dagger**

Delivers a ranged attack with a potency of 120. The range for this GCD is 15 yalms. Grants 5 Ninki.

**Death Blossom**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 120 to all nearby enemies. This is an Area of Effect (AoE) ability and deals damage in a five yalm radius around you. This is the first part of our AoE combo. Grants 5 Ninki.

![HakkeMujinsatsu](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002923_hr1.png)  
**Hakke Mujinsatsu**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies. If done as the second part of our AoE combo, it instead delivers an attack with a potency of 140 to all nearby enemies, as well as adds ten seconds to your Huton timer assuming your Huton timer is already going. Just like Death Blossom, this is an AoE attack that deals damage in a five yalm radius around you. Grants 5 Ninki if used in combo.

# Ninjutsus/Mudras

Ninjutsus set off a global cooldown of 1.5 seconds upon use, not reducible by Huton or skill speed, and each use of a ninjutsu will use up one mudra charge. Mudras have a shared 2 charges, which are used by using a ninjutsu, a charge time of 20 seconds per charge, and can only be started when a normal GCD could be started. Instead of a 2.5 or 1.5 second global cooldown, the mudras themselves only give a .5 second global cooldown.

Also applies a 40% heavy on enemies in this AoE. This lasts for 24 seconds, resulting in 800 potency over all the ticks, to a combined potency of 900 altogether. This is achieved by any three-mudra combination ending in Chi. So, Ten>Jin>Chi or Jin>Ten>Chi. The AoE has a radius of five yalms.

![Mug](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000613_hr1.png)  
**Mug**

Delivers an attack with a potency of 150. Grants 40 Ninki gauge on use. Also increases the chance of additional items being dropped by target if mug is dealt before, or as, the finishing blow. This extra thing is mostly irrelevant since it only works on basic drops that you don't end up caring about, like Bat Fangs. This skill has a personal cooldown of 120 seconds.

Delivers an attack with a potency of 200 that is guaranteed to be a critical direct hit. This can only be used under the buff Assassinate Ready (see: Dream Within a Dream). Using this ability will consume the buff Assassinate Ready. 

![TenChiJin](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002922_hr1.png)  
**Ten Chi Jin (TCJ)**

Temporarily converts each of the three mudra into a ninjutsu action.
