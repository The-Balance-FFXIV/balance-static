![Ninja standard opener graphic. ](/img/jobs/nin/earlymug3.png "Ninja Standard Opener")



⦿ Late weave Trick Attack as much as possible without clipping. \
⦿ Mug should be held a GCD after the opener (at next usage) then used strictly off cooldown after.\
⦿ It is important for the Suiton prepull to start being prepared at -6s on the countdown and used at -1s. This will not early pull the boss and will allow future Mudras to come off cooldown sooner.

⦿ This version uses  Trick Attack at 4th GCD instead of the standard 3rd. Susceptible to Trick drifting a GCD later in a full uptime fight, which could separate Trick from Mug by 2 GCDs, unless Mug was also held an additional GCD (at most, 1 GCD separation between Trick and Mug is desired).\
⦿ Exits the opener only slightly higher than 3rd GCD Trick, however under full uptime performs nearly the same. ⦿ Hold Mug a GCD after the opener (next usage) then strictly off cooldown after. This will align it with other 20s and 15s buffs.\
⦿ It is important for the Suiton prepull to start being prepared at -6s on the countdown and used at -1s. This will not early pull the boss and will allow future Mudras to come off cooldown sooner.
