* Suiton prepull preparation should be at -6.0 seconds and cast approximately -0.90 seconds on the timer. This will shorten our cooldown on mudra and ensure we can get x2 Raiton under Kunai’s Bane after the opener
* Ideally drift Dokumori 1 GCD post opener, to allow for better alignment with all other raid buffs. We use it so early in the opener due to Bunshin.
* Can catch the last Raiju (Extended Standard) with very late woven Kunai’s Bane. More in the Advanced Guide.

* Similar to the above with Suiton and drifting Dokomori.
* This uses Kunai’s Bane a GCD earlier, but is a slightly weaker opener.
* This opener is preferable on 2.10 GCD due to inherit drift on that speed.
