It is important for the Suiton pre-pull to start being prepared at -6s on the countdown and used at -1s. This will not early pull the boss and will allow future Mudras to come off cooldown sooner.



Trick Attack is also a late weave in the opener to align with other raid buffs. Weave it as late as you can without clipping. 



*Note: Trick is only purposely weaved late in the opener. Use on cooldown after the opener.*
 

If you play at high ping (>40ms), you may skip the Spinning Edge at the end of the opener and go straight into Raiton instead, as fitting Spinning Edge under Trick is extremely tight.
