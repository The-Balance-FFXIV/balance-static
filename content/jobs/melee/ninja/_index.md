Ninja is a melee DPS focused on high-output burst windows. The rotation is extremely flexible, with one of the strongest raid buff contributions in the game. Mudras are the backbone of our burst, and combined with their charge system, allow us to do insane damage inside of buffs while also having plenty of options when forced to disconnect. On top of that, Ninja is the most mobile melee and can adapt easily to any situation which presents itself.
