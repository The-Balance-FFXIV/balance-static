# "Which opener do I pick?"

It depends on when your group is bursting. 5/7s don't have any major implications one way or the other for us, so do what fits your party the best. 

The choice between demo opener and dk opener will likely depend on your group’s buff timings or fight phasing: ***choose dk opener as the default.***

As always, the choice between double lunar and solar lunar depends on your killtime. If using solar lunar gains you a PR (ending the fight on an odd rof window), use that.

## Solar Lunar

##### DK First variation

## Burst Windows

##### Even Burst window

From the perspective of someone fresh off of 2.5 years of optimal drift, the new set of burst rules are far easier than the rof+bhx of the past. Essentially, it boils down to a small set of steps.

1. Press PB after an opo gcd in the 3 to 1 gcd range before RoF. (This is the period of time about \~7.4ish to \~3ish seconds before RoF comes off cd.)
2. Do your first PB window
3. Use your formless on opo
4. Use any Replies
5. Use your formless on opo
6. Do your second PB window
7. Use your formless on opo

##### Odd Burst window

Your only aim in odd burst is to put the blitz, replies, and your formless/pb gcds within RoF. Here are some rules to get you started:

1. Find the first opo within RoF to launch your PB window off of.
2. Spend your formless on opo gcds
3. Cast Fire's Reply after an opo gcd.
4. Cast Wind's Reply literally anywhere in the window.
