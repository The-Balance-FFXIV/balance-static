# **Basic Monk Guide**

Welcome to the basic guide for Monk, which will cover all of the information necessary to get you off your feet and onto your hands. Included is a look into the various systems that come together to define the Monk playstyle, suggested openers, and explanations on how to correctly form burst windows.

Throughout this guide we will be referring to all skills as if you were level 100. This is significant if you are still leveling, as some skills start out with a different name and upgrade upon reaching a certain level. The skills affected by this are as follows:

| Initial  Name        | Upgraded Name           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Arm of the Destroyer | Shadow of the Destroyer |
| Steel Peak           | The Forbidden Chakra    |
| Howling Fist         | Enlightenment           |
| Flint Strike         | Rising Phoenix          |
| Tornado Kick         | Phantom Rush            |
| Elixir Field         | Elixir Burst            |
| Bootshine            | Leaping Opo             |
| True Strike          | Rising Raptor           |
| Snap Punch           | Pouncing Coeurl         |

# Monk Basics

## Uptime

As a Monk, uptime should be your top priority. Uptime itself is a multifaceted word; firstly, it refers to how physically close you are to an enemy. You can't punch that which you are far away from, and as such always keep in mind that you want to be as close as possible for as long as possible. Of course, if you have to step away to do a mechanic or dodge an aoe do so, but the mind of a Monk should always be looking to *minimize* the amount of time we spend not-hitting something; whether that's not running so far away to do aforementioned mechanics, or running back to the boss sooner after aoe damage snapshots, it is something to always be working on.

Secondly, uptime refers to the amount of time you spend hitting the boss. It's great if you can stay within striking distance of your foe permanently, but if you aren't pressing buttons, you're not doing any damage. Don't fret too much about only wanting to press the "correct" buttons for your rotation; pressing something is better than pressing nothing. You have plenty of time to review mistakes and correct yourself on what you *should've* done after the fact, the key is to make sure you're always doing *something.*

Of course uptime isn't exclusively important to Monk, but it *is* a key aspect to being a *good* Monk, and so it's important to keep these principles in mind as you're learning; after all, as the job with the fastest GCD in the game, each second wasted not casting is comparably more valuable to a Monk than to another job.

## Positionals

It's unlikely that you've made the decision to play Monk while remaining unaware of the P-word, but in case you've not come across it before, a "positional" is a skill that only gains maximum effect when used at a specific part of an enemy's hitbox: in Monk's case, either flank or rear. Alas, where we once had six positionals, in Endwalker we've been reduced to having simply two:

* **Demolish** deals maximum damage when executed from behind an enemy.
* **Pouncing Coeurl**, on the other hand, is best used from an enemy's flank (side).

Missing either positional is a 60 potency loss, which will add up over a fight. Try to ensure you're never missing any positionals.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DBLRYTX.png "Combat Dummy - Positional Indicator")

The arrow on the top indicates the target's front. The the two arrows either side are another indication of where a target is facing, as well as defining the left and right of a boss. The entire section at the back where the double line ends counts as the "rear", whereas the double lines either side count as the "flank". As such, you are able to stand at the intercardinal of a hitbox and take just a step to the left/right to adjust for your positionals, as opposed to having to run all the way from directly rear to directly left, for example.

In some instances you will encounter a hitbox that is a completely closed circle. These enemies are omnipositional, meaning you will always get the positional bonus regardless of where you are.

## The Form System

Forms are a concept unique to Monk, and are what separates it from standard combo-based melee jobs. Unlike other jobs that simply have combos that trigger each other in a static manner, you can combo any GCD into any other GCD - providing that you're progressing your form forward. Each GCD also gains a bonus effect when used in the correct form, meaning you want to keep your forms advancing forward and not break your combo, else you'll drop your form and your damage will suffer.

You have three forms: Opo-Opo, Raptor, and Coeurl:

* In Opo-Opo form, Leaping Opo, Dragon Kick, and Shadow of the Destroyer gain additional effects. Using an Opo-opo GCD grants you Raptor form.
* In Raptor form, Rising Raptor, Twin Snakes, and Four-point Fury gain additional effects. Using a Raptor GCD grants you Coeurl form.
* In Coeurl form, Pouncing Coeurl, Demolish, and Rockbreaker gain additional effects. Using a Coeurl GCD grants you Opo-opo form.

## Core GCDs

As previously mentioned, Monk has six core single-target GCDs.

| Gainers                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Dragon Kick](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002528_hr1.png)     | **Dragon Kick** has a potency of 320. When in Opo-Opo form, it will grant *Opo-opo's Fury*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ![Twin Snakes](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000213_hr1.png)     | **Twin Snakes** has a potency of 420. Twin Snakes can only be executed from Raptor form and will grant *Raptor's Fury*.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Demolish](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000204_hr1.png)        | **Demolish** has a potency of 360, or 420 when executed from the rear. It can only be executed from Coeurl form and will grant two *Coeurl's Fury*.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Leaping Opo](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002982_hr1.png)     | **Leaping Opo** has a potency of 260, or 460 when you have *Opo-opo's Fury*. When in Opo-Opo form, Bootshine will always crit.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ![Rising Raptor](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002983_hr1.png)   | **Rising Raptor** has a potency of 340, or 540 when you have *Raptor's Fury*. It can only be executed from Raptor form.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Pouncing Coeurl](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002984_hr1.png) | **Pouncing Coeurl** has a potency of 310, or 520 when executed from the flank and when you have *Coeurl's Fury*. It can only be executed from Coeurl form.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ![Form Shift](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002536_hr1.png)      | **Form Shift** is a unique GCD, as it's not directly a part of our rotation, but it does enable our rotation. Form Shift grants the Formless Fist buff, which allows you to use any GCD and gain its additional form effects. Since this GCD does no damage, we only ever use it before pulling an enemy or during downtime. |

&nbsp;

## Basic Rotation in a Vacuum

With the knowledge of these GCDs, we can actually already begin to build what will be the foundation of our rotation. Now, we know that we're going to be doing a three-step combo, but that we have two options for GCDs at each step; how do we decide which one to press?

Effectively, each step of our rotation has a Filler and a Spender option. **Dragon Kick**, **Twin Snakes** and **Demolish** gain you Fury, these fill the respective job gauge to full, thus Filler. **Leaping Opo**, **Rising Raptor** and **Pouncing Coeurl** will spend the Fury from the respective job gauge, thus Spender.

At each step, consult your job gauge, is there a Fury ball for your current form? Press the Spender GCD. Is it empty? Press the Filler GCD. This means we end up alternating **Dragon Kick** with **Leaping Opo**, **Twin Snakes** with **Rising Raptor** and for every **Demolish** we follow with two **Pouncing Coeurl**. The GCDs on the hotbar will also light up correctly following this logic, as such the glowing buttons can be followed as well.

## AoE Rotation

Our AoE rotation is quite simple. As opposed to other jobs that will have an entirely different combo for AoE, we simply have an AoE option for each of our forms.

| ![Shadow of the Destroyer](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002979_hr1.png) | Opo-opo form has **Shadow of the Destroyer**, a circle AoE around you with 110 potency which becomes a guaranteed critical hit when executed with its form bonus. |
| ![Four-Point Fury](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002544_hr1.png)         | Raptor form has **Four-Point Fury**, another circle AoE around you with 120 potency.                                                                              |
| ![Rockbreaker](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002529_hr1.png)             | Coeurl form has **Rockbreaker**, *another* circle AoE around you with 130 potency.                                                                                |

\**Always crits.*

While the AOE GCDs are very simple in Dawntrail, when to use them at Level 100 is not as obvious. Shadow of the Destroyer is always a gain on 3 targets, Four-Point Fury is only a gain on 4 targets. For Rockbreaker it depends on the amount of Critical Hit one has. We need at minimum 2797 Critical Hit for Rockbreaker to be worth it on 3 targets, otherwise it is only worth it on 4. If a AOE of some form is not worth using on a certain number of targets, we use the regular single target versions of that form.

## Chakra

| Filled Chakra Gauge                  | Chakra Gauge in Brotherhood           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| ![](/img/jobs/mnk/chakra5.png)       | ![](/img/jobs/mnk/chakra10.png)       |

Chakra is the simplest of our three job gauges. Chakra can be stacked up to five times, and once five stacks have been built, we can spend them on either a single target oGCD or an AoE Line oGCD, depending on the scenario. In Brotherhood, our Chakra can be stacked up to ten times.

| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002534_hr1.png) | First is Meditation, a GCD with a one second cooldown that opens a single Chakra upon being pressed. When outside of combat it generates five stacks of Chakra instantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/005000/005238_hr1.png) | We then have two traits: Deep Meditation I & II. Deep Meditation I grants an 80% chance of generating a Chakra upon landing a critical weaponskill. Deep Meditation II turns that 80% chance into a 100% chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002542_hr1.png) | Finally, we have Brotherhood. Brotherhood has multiple effects, but in this section we'll just talk about the effect pertaining to Chakra. Upon execution, party members within 15 yalms will gain the effect of Meditative Brotherhood for 15 seconds. While this buff is active on an ally, every time they execute a weaponskill or a spell, there is a 20% chance that you will gain a stack of Chakra. While the buff is active on yourself, you have a 100% chance to gain a Chakra each time you execute a weaponskill and the Chakra Limit is increased to 10. |

&nbsp;

Brotherhood Chakra gain is based on damage application. This means that following the use of a GCD with a slower damage application such as Demolish, your Chakra gain will occur much later in the GCD roll than it would after a Snap Punch, for example.

We can spend our Chakra on either of the following two oGCDs:

|                                                 |                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002535_hr1.png) | **The Forbidden Chakra** is a single target attack with a potency of 400. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002545_hr1.png) | **Enlightenment** is a line AoE with a potency of 200.                    |

&nbsp;

## Beast Chakra - How They Work

Beast Chakra was introduced in Endwalker, and hinges around the changes to Perfect Balance.

Perfect Balance has has two charges and a 40s cooldown. Upon executing a weaponskill, it grants a Beast Chakra of the corresponding Form. We can then spend these Beast Chakra on one of four Blitz weaponskills depending on the Chakra we had accumulated. Upon using any of these Blitzes, we're granted Formless Fist, allowing us to proceed with our rotation without having to do any GCDs without their form bonus.

| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002985_hr1.png) | If we have three of the same type of Beast Chakra, our Masterful Blitz will become **Elixir Burst**, an AoE with a potency of 900 that deals 70% less damage to all subsequent targets hit. Using Elixir Field will grant us a Lunar Nadi.                                              | Lunar here                   |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002980_hr1.png) | If we have three different Beast Chakra, our Masterful Blitz becomes **Rising Phoenix**, an AoE with a potency of 900 that deals 70% less damage to all subsequent targets hit. Using Rising Phoenix will grant us a Solar Nadi.                                                        | ![](/img/jobs/mnk/solar.png) |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002977_hr1.png) | If we have two different Beast Chakra, Masterful Blitz becomes **Celestial Revolution**, a single-target attack with a potency of 600. Using Celestial Revolution will grant us a Lunar Nadi by default, but if we already possess the Lunar Nadi it will instead give us a Solar Nadi. | CR here                      |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002981_hr1.png) | If we have both the Solar and Lunar Nadi active, any combination of three Beast Chakra will turn Masterful Blitz into **Phantom Rush**, an AoE with a potency of 1500 potency that deals 50% less damage to all subsequent targets hit. It consumes both Nadi upon use.                 | PR here                      |

&nbsp;

Our Goal will be to get as many **Phantom Rushes** as we can in a fight. For this we will need a **Lunar** Nadi and a **Solar** Nadi. Using **Rising Phoenix** grants us a Solar Nadi. For Solar Nadis 3 Beast Chakras of different forms are required, one Opo-opo, one Raptor and one Coeurl Beast Chakra. We use one GCD of each form as per our Fury Gauge. For the Lunar Nadi we will need to use an **Elixir Burst**, which is granted by generating 3 Beast Chakra of the same form. The best form to use here is alternating our Opo-opo GCDs. This is because Leaping Opo is our strongest GCD.

Having collected both Nadis, our next use of Perfect Balance will grant us the **Phantom Rush** Masterful Blitz, regardless of which Beast Chakra we have used. Even though it does not matter which Beast Chakra we use to get the Masterful Blitz, Opo-opo will again be the strongest. 

We want to avoid using **Celestial Revolution** at all costs, however it is somewhat benevolent and will still progress us towards building a Phantom Rush.

## Riddle of Fire + Brotherhood

| Icon                                            | Name               | Effect                                                                                                                   | Duration | Cooldown |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002541_hr1.png) | **Riddle of Fire** | Increases damage dealt by 15%. Grants Fire's Rumination.                                                                 | 20s      | 60s      |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002542_hr1.png) | **Brotherhood**    | Grants Brotherhood and Meditative Brotherhood to all party members within 30y. Brotherhood increases damage dealt by 5%. | 20s      | 120s     |

&nbsp;

On the face of it, Riddle of Fire and Brotherhood are pretty simple skills. We press Riddle of Fire and do more damage for the next 20 seconds. We press Brotherhood and both we and our party do more damage for the next 20 seconds. While the burst windows that we build around these skills using the rest of our kit can be complex, the actual usage of these skills themselves are very simple. In a full uptime vacuum we simply press them on cooldown every single time they come back up. Make sure you're always weaving RoF in the latter half of your GCD roll to ensure you get a full 11 GCDs under the buff. 

In Dawntrail, Riddle of Fire as the additional effect of granting Fire's Rumination, which allows us the use of **Fire's Reply** during RoF, introduced in a later section.

## Riddle of Wind

| Icon                                            | Name               | Effect                                                      | Duration | Cooldown |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002978_hr1.png) | **Riddle of Wind** | Reduces auto-attack delay by 50%. Grants Wind's Rumination. | 15s      | 90s      |

&nbsp;

Functionally, you can think of Riddle of Wind as a DoT, or as a damaging oGCD. Given that it has a 90s CD, it's sometimes going to fall out of buffs; this is okay. In a vacuum, you just press Riddle of Wind on CD forever, getting the maximum amount of uses while every other usage misaligns itself from your buffs. In a real scenario, such as an encounter where you have a specific killtime/phase time in mind, you can afford to hold it into buffs when you know you aren't going to lose a usage by doing so.

I'll give an example of a six minute encounter. Over the course of six minutes, you'd get four uses of RoW: 0:00, 1:30, 3:00, and 4:30. You'll notice that if you were to use RoW at these times, you'll get one usage at 3:00 under an odd RoF, but every other use will be misaligned from buffs.

What you could instead do is pop it at 0:00, 2:00, 3:30, 5:00. Here you get one use in your even RoF, as well as another usage at 5:00 in an odd RoF.

In Dawntrail, Riddle of Wind also grants Wind's Rumination, allowing the use of **Wind's Reply** during its effect.

## Fire's Reply and Wind's Reply

| Icon                                            | Name             | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002987_hr1.png) | **Fire's Reply** | Can be used while under the effect of Fire's Rumination granted by Riddle of Fire. This ranged attack explodes around an enemy with 1200 potency and for 50% reduced potency for enemies around the primary target. Also grants Formless Fist after use. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002986_hr1.png) | **Wind's Reply** | Can be Used while under the effect of Wind's Rumination granted by Riddle of Wind. This medium range attack hits everything in a line for 900 potency for the first target, and the remaining targets at 50% reduced potency.                            |

&nbsp;

**Fire's Reply** features a 20 yalm range and is our second highest hitting skill in our kit with 1200 potency. Ideally it is always used after an Opo-opo form GCD, as it grants Formless Fist, allowing us to continue with another Opo-opo form GCD right after. Its great range makes this also a very good downtime tool if it happens to align.

**Wind's Reply** features an awkward 10 yalm range and is also a fairly high hitting skill with 700 potency. As opposed to Fire's Reply, Wind's Reply can be flexibly used during the duration of Riddle of Wind and Wind's Rumination. It does not break combo, and can also be used as a downtime tool.

## Utility and Misc. Skills

This is the part where I cover everything that's been missed until now. We've covered everything you'd need to know in a dummy scenario, so now let's take a quick tour of the toolkit that we find ourselves using as soon as we leave the dummy and get into a real encounter.

|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002547_hr1.png) | **Six-Sided Star** is a GCD with a potency of 780, but double the recast of every other GCD. In Dawntrail SSS also consumes all your Chakra with the same 80 potency per Chakra as The Forbidden Chakra. While doing two GCDs is always more potency than doing one SSS, this is useful in scenarios where you don't have the time to do two GCDs, or before you disengage from a target. A situational skill, you'll either use it before running out of a big aoe, before a boss dies, or before a boss goes untargetable for whatever reason. It also applies a small movement speed buff for five seconds. Overall a very useful utility GCD. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002537_hr1.png) | **Riddle of Earth** is an oGCD with a 120s CD. It reduces damage taken by 20% for 10 seconds, and if damage is taken during this period you are granted the effect of Earth's Resolve, a 100 potency 15 second duration heal over time. Also grants Earth's Rumination for 30 seconds, allowing the use of **Earth's Reply**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002549_hr1.png) | **Earth's Reply** can be used while under the effect of Earth's Rumination. It creates a small AoE around you that heals for a considerable amount. It has increased healing potency while also under the effect of Earth's Resolve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002975_hr1.png) | **Thunderclap** is our mobility tool, an oGCD with a 30s CD and three charges. It can target both your enemy or a party member, and provides us a decent amount of flexibility, being able to zip around up to three times in a row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000216_hr1.png) | **Mantra** is an oGCD with a 15s duration and a 90s CD. It increases healing received by you and all party members within 30y by 10%, which is quite a strong mitigation tool. Given that a lot of the shields in this game (Succor, Aspected Helios, etc.) are based on the amount of healing done, it means that Mantra can be used to provide both increased healing and greater shielding. You should discuss with your healers when to use it for maximum benefit.                                                                                                                                                                           |

This is a very nice tool now, as we're finally able to use it in fights that have no physical damage sources. As a tool for both progression and optimization it's invaluable, and you should discuss with your healers and tanks where it's best used for maximum effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

# Rotational Choices
## Burst in Theory
### Riddle of Fire and Brotherhood
Firstly, we want to get the **maximum number of uses** of **Riddle of Fire**. **RoF** has a duration of 20 seconds, this means Monk can fit 11 GCDs into a **late-weave** **RoF**. It is absolutely crucial to use **RoF** late into the GCD roll such that it can catch the 11th GCD. **Broterhood** also has a duration of 20 seconds and we are aiming to align it as well as we can with our **RoF** and other party buffs.

Using **Riddle of Fire** also grants us one use of **Fire's Reply** during its duration and it should never be skipped. As **Fire's Reply** grants us **Formless Fist**, we are aiming to use it after an Opo-opo GCD (**Leaping Opo** or **Dragon Kick**) and follow it with another Opo-opo GCD. 

### Odd and Even Windows
**Riddle of Fire** has a cooldown of 60 seconds, where **Brotherhood** sits at 120 seconds. This results with us pressing **Riddle of Fire** every minute, where ever other minute it will be paired with **Broterhood**. Given that half of our burst windows consist solely of **RoF** and the other half have both **RoF** and **BH**, we have names to distinguish between them: **even** and **odd** windows.


The windows are named after the minute they occur in an encounter. **RoF** and **BH** are used together at the start of the fight and the align every 2 minutes (0, 2, 4, 6...), hence even window. **RoF** is used on its own every minute after even windows (1, 3, 5, 7, ...), hence odd window. 

As the even window contains all the raid buffs including your own raid buff **BH**, we prioritise this window over the odd window. With the cooldown of **Perfect Balance** being 40 seconds, this allows to fit the following GCDs into each window>

- Even: 2x **Masterful Blitz**, 1x **Fire's Reply**
- Odd: 1x **Masterful Blitz**, 1x **Fire's Reply**
- **Wind's Reply** should also be used in both windows, whenever **Riddle of Wind** aligns.

### Riddle of Wind and Wind's Reply
**Riddle of Wind** being on a cooldown of 90 seconds means that it will only align with a **Riddle of Fire** every other use if used on cooldown (every 3 minutes). Using **RoW** will allow us to use **Wind's Reply** once during its duration. This naturally means that just as **RoW**, **Wind's Reply** also does not always align with every **RoF** window.

While using **Riddle of Wind** on cooldown guarantees the maximum usages, sometimes we can strategically delay **RoW** to make it align with **RoF**, we do this only if it does not lose us an overall usage. This again requires knowledge or a good guess of the kill time, if it is unknown, **Riddle of Wind** is best used on cooldown.

Compared to its counter-part, **Wind's Reply** can be used very freely, as it **does not** come with the benefit of **Formless Fist** or any other benefits than its mediocre medium range. We are free to use it in any part of the rotation.

### Perfect Balance and Opo-opo Optimisation
**Perfect Balance** allows us to use GCDs of any of the 3 forms and using the resulting **Masterful Blitz** grants us **Formless Fist**. As mentioned previously, Opo-opo GCDs are our strongest regular GCDs, as such we are looking to optimize the use of **Perfect Balance** to maximize our Opo-opo GCDs.

First and foremost we do this by placement of **Perfect Balance**. Ideally it should always be placed after and follow an Opo-opo GCD.

Secondly is sequencing. When using **Perfect Balance** to execute an **Elixir Burst** or a **Phantom Rush**, we are exclusively using Opo-opo GCDs. When building a **Rising Phoenix**, we are forced to use one GCD of each form. It might not be immediately obvious, but the order of those GCDs do matter. 

A very common optimisation we can make for the Solar **PB** sequence for **Rising Phoenix** is pressing **PB** slightly before **RoF** following an Opo-opo GCD, such that **RoF** will come up before one of the three GCDs of the sequence. We can then order the three GCDs from weakest to strongest and this will often result in a weaker GCD being moved before **RoF** and stronger GCDs into **RoF**. Examples will be shown in the **Burst in Practice** section.

Third is the placement relative to buffs. **Perfect Balance** has a 40 second cooldown and allows us to hold 2 charges. Our burst windows occur along 120 second intervals. We can fit 3 uses of Perfect Balance across this 2 minute span of time. We have established that the even window is the stronger of the 2 burst windows, and so we will put 2 uses of Perfect Balance into our even windows, and 1 use into our odd windows.

### Nadi Alignment and Overcapping

Keeping in mind that **Opo-opo** GCDs are our strongest form and **Phantom Rush** being our strongest GCD, we aim to optimise the amount of both, and also moving as many into Riddle of Fire and other buffs. If we follow the guideline of using two **Perfect Balance** in even windows and one **Perfect Balance** in odd windows, then we will collect a Solar Nadi and a Lunar Nadi in our opener, which will naturally give us our first **Phantom Rush** in the first odd minute window.

If we strategically overcap the same Nadi by generating the same one twice, we can move **Phantom Rush** into our 2 minutes and subsequent even windows instead. This is usually preferred as the even windows contain both your buffs, as well as buffs of your party members. While ensuring that our strongest GCD is fully buffed sounds enticing, it might cause us to lose a **Phantom Rush** overall, as we are effectively pushing back the PR by one **Perfect Balance** usage. However with the buffs to **Phantom Rush** and Lunar sequences in Dawntrail, the loss of a **Phantom Rush** is usually not very significant the longer the fights become. Our preferred Nadi to overcap is the Lunar one, as it produces more Opo-opo GCDs. 

The choice of optimal Nadi Alignment can change from fight to fight, but will mostly depend on the kill time.

## Burst in Practice
### Solar Odd Windows
### Lunar Odd Windows
### Even Windows

## Openers
With Nadi Alignment and Overcapping in mind, there are two primary openers available to us, though additional options and variations exist. Our best options are a **Double Lunar** and **Solar Lunar** openers and their variations. **Solar Lunar** aims to maximize the amounts of **Phantom Rushes**, as it does not overcap the Nadi like the **Double Lunar** opener does. The choice of the opener will decide what our subsequent odd and even windows will look like. 

### Lunar Solar

![Lunar Solar Opener](/img/jobs/mnk/mnkguide_0000_lunarsolar.png "Lunar Solar Opener")

This opener is effectively the "Guaranteed Max Phantom Rush uses" opener; it starts out by generating both a Lunar and a Solar Nadi and banishing our PR to the land of the one-minute buffs. The opener requires a double weave if you wish to preserve the same Brotherhood timing as the double Solar opener. If you and your group are fine to delay BH by one GCD, simply move it + Riddle of Wind one oGCD slot down.

### Double Solar

![Double Solar Opener](/img/jobs/mnk/mnkguide_0002_doublesolar.png "Double Solar Opener")

Doing two Rising Phoenix overcaps us on Solar Nadi; that is intentional. This is done for Phantom Rush alignment, as pushing PR into the two minute window can be beneficial provided we have an ideal killtime and a party composition with a lot of two minute buffs.

Brotherhood's placement is flexible should it ever need to be moved to account for your party composition.

## Picking Your Path

Monk now has three different primary choices as to how you'd like to play. Available to us are the **braindead looping** rotation, the **optimal drift** rotation, and the **double solar** rotation:

* The looping rotation forces a couple of minor "misplays" in order to form a rotation that naturally loops itself every two minutes, providing an easier gameplay experience for first timers. 
* The optimal drift rotation consists of more nuanced burst windows, with multiple potential even windows depending on which Coeurl GCD happens around a Riddle of Fire.
* The double solar rotation follows a set of rules based on Perfect Balance entries around Riddle of Fire windows for potentially higher DPS that relies on stricter conditions to excel.

![Opener Analysis](/img/jobs/mnk/mnkguide_0006_rotations.png "Opener Analysis")

The image above demonstrates the DPS difference between each of the three rotations given an uninterrupted 8:30 sim. As you can see it’s incredibly tight between all three options. I would recommend starting out with the loop to get a feel for the job, progressing on to Optimal Drift if you decide you enjoy it and wish to push the job further. Double Solar is relegated to specific scenarios; it must be a kill time that will not lose you a use of Phantom Rush (6:30, 8:30, etc) and your party composition should contain a reasonable amount of two minute raid buffs to really leverage the enhanced two minute burst. In 99% of situations you are better using Optimal Drift, however when the stars align Double Solar does get to have its’ time in the sun (all puns intended). Double Solar becomes comparatively stronger than the other options the longer a fight goes (assuming you do not lose a Phantom Rush), and can sometimes gain an edge by allowing you to better use either the targeted AoE or the AoE centered around yourself in order to cleave more targets.
