# Advanced Monk - Out of the Ballpit

- - -

You have made it out of the ballpit and you know about the standard Monk rotation, as well as its Openers and Burst Windows. In the following section we will introduce knowledge that will help answer some questions about why the standard rotation is standard, and in more advanced fashion, why other considerations are not standard. As well as basic understanding of game mechanics, spreadsheet territory targeting single digit gains and in traditional fashion, cursed knowledge.


## Busting Your Balls


Breaking out of common Nadi pathing In the following section we will recap the standard rotation, discuss fundamental mechanics and why we are allowed a certain degree of flexibility, basic guidelines to optimizing Monk and the thought process of optimizing Monk for a specific fight.

### Recapping Standard Monk
The standard Monk rotation follows the following guidelines:
- Outside of Perfect Balance, Opo-opo is followed by Raptor, Raptor is followed by Coeurl, Coeurl is followed by Opo-opo.
- We use the Filler GCDs if we do not have balls, and we use the Spender GCDs if we have balls. Live by the balls, die by the balls.
- Elixir Burst and the resulting Lunar Nadi consist of a 3x Opo-opo PB sequence. Similarly Phantom Rush is also made using the Lunar sequence.
- Rising Phoenix and the resulting Solar Nadi consist of a Opo-opo, Raptor and Coeurl PB sequence.
- Brotherhood, Riddle of Fire and Riddle of Wind are used on cooldown.
- Perfect Balance and Fire’s Reply are always used after Opo-opo GCDs.
- Formless Fist is always spent on Opo-opo GCDs.
- We use 2 Masterful Blitz, Fire’s Reply and Wind’s Reply (where applicable) in BH+RoF every even  minute window.
- We use 1 Masterful Blitz, Fire’s Reply and Wind’s Reply (where applicable) in RoF every odd minute window.



If we do the Solar Lunar Opener, we arrive at the standard Monk rotation, we will never waste resources and we will never lose a Phantom Rush. The Double Lunar and Triple Lunar openers overcaps the Lunar Nadis, overcapping Nadis in the opener is considered as standard, but overcapping otherwise is not technically considered as standard as it will immediately lead to guaranteed Phantom Rush losses.

### Introducing Nadi Notation

For the following sections, we will introduce the standard Nadi rotation to help readability.
- S - **S**olar sequence, Rising Phoenix
- L - **L**unar sequence, Elixir Burst
- (L), (S), (C) - Phantom Rush executed using a **L**unar sequence (usually 3x Opo-opo), **S**olar sequence (Opo-opo, Raptor, Coeurl) or an arbitrary “**C**elestial Revolution” sequence.

As an example, the Solar Lunar path throughout a 6:30 fight will have the following sequence of Nadis.

> <pre>SL  (L)  SL  (L)  SL  (L)  SL</pre>

Similarly, Double Lunar and Triple Lunar followed by standard rotation.

> <pre>LL  S  (L)L  S  (L)L  S  (L)L</pre>

Introducing this notation will help us to quickly understand the progression through the Nadis throughout a fight, analyze the overcaps and overall uses of Phantom Rush, Elixir Burst and Rising Phoenix.
