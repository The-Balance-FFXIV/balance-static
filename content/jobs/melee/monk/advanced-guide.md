# Advanced Monk Gameplay Techniques: Reaching Enlightenment

## Opener Variations

The two basic opener choices are not going to work perfectly in every situation. As such, we can modify our openers quite easily in order to better suit our needs.

### Early Openers

An early opener is exactly what it sounds like. By skipping past the Opo GCD straight into a Twin Snakes, we are able to get our buffs on cooldown sooner. These openers are generally used in situations where a phase or fight would end while we are still in a buff window in order to squeeze more effective usage out of those buffs. If, for instance, an encounter ends at 6:20 and we are using a standard opener timing, we will only be able to leverage roughly 16 seconds out of Riddle of Fire, and 12 seconds of Brotherhood. By doing an early opener, we would instead be able to get the full usage of both buffs.

### Double Lunar

It goes without saying, but the Double Lunar opener is *incredibly* fight specific. It's a much slower opener than any of our other options, with Riddle of Fire not being used until after the 4th GCD. Ideally for *us*, Brotherhood would also come out later to better cover our burst, however the slight gains that we would personally get from this do not outweigh the negative effect it would have on our teammates. 

Generally the only reason for using this opener is going to be if the delayed blitzes hit multiple targets where standard timings would not. Potential pitfalls to keep in mind when considering where to use this opener include being slightly desynced from raid buffs, being forced into Double Solar even windows hence potentially losing a Phantom Rush, and potentially losing time on Riddle of Fire.
