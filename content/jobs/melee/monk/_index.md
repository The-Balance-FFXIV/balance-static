Monk is a fast-paced, flexible melee DPS job that finds strength in its adaptability. The job plays by juggling its various buffs and debuffs - Leaden Fist, Disciplined Fist, and Demolish -  in order to maximise its damage, and as such its rotation is incredibly fluid as it flows from one Riddle of Fire burst window to the next.
