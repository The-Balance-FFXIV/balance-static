Monk is a fast-paced, flexible melee DPS job that finds strength in its adaptability. The job plays by moving through various forms, entering burst windows fluidly and easily, maximising damage by building and spending stacks of Fury Gauge, and manipulating forms through the use of Perfect Balance during its Riddle of Fire windows.
