  - question: Is Double True Strike dead?
    answer: As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
  - question: What's with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
    answer: With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK's higher potency and
      again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden
      Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit
      one.
  - question: What do non opener RoF windows look like?
    answer: Similar to opener, you may not have Leaden Fist while going into it though.
  - question: Is Twin Snakes meant to drop for a bit?
    answer: Two GCDs without Twin Snakes after each Perfect Balance window is intended.
  - question: What food is good?
    answer: Depends on your stats, but the BiS uses Smoked Chicken.
  - question: Any recommendations for crafted gear/First week raiding gear melds?

      Crafted with non-savage stuff dropped in and 1 DH meld to DET: <https://etro.gg/gearset/4b5883ff-8b9e-46fc-8fc3-62d255596e6d>


      If you're considering getting the Emerald Weapon/Pants later, you may as well flip that one meld on the initial set.
  - question: Where can I try out changes to the rotation?
    answer: "Try the sim found in here: <https://discord.gg/M9BYeJN>"
  - question: Why does the BiS have so many DET melds?
    answer: >-
      Every time someone asks I add another DET meld to the BiS and therefore
      only the few people who notice contribute to the problem.


      (The real reason is stat tiering.)
  - question: Got a good visualization of the Rotation?
    answer: >-

      out in a vacuum

  - question: '"RoF is coming up too early in my rotation, what do?"'
    answer: This likely means your GCD is too fast, and should naturally fix itself
      when you reach the desired GCD threshold of 1.96. In the meantime, you can
      fix this by doing an additional uncomboed Dragon Kick following a previous
      Dragon Kick. This will slow you down by one GCD and should realign RoF
      with Demolish.
  - question: "\"Why don't I get Leaden Fist after using PB?\""
    answer: As mentioned in the guide, your first GCD after PB is formless so will
      not grant you a Leaden Fist. This is totally fine and normal.
  - question: '"If I end PB with Leaden Fist, should I not do an uncomboed Bootshine
      instead?"'
    answer: No, as this would be a waste of the Leaden Fist proc. You want all of
      your Bootshines to be guaranteed crits, so you would stick to the rule of
      "Always DK after PB" to make sure the Leaden isn't eaten by an uncomboed
      Boot. Remember, we're not 'wasting' / 'overcapping' on Leaden stacks here,
      as the DK is uncomboed.
  - question: '"What should I meld on X item?"'
    answer: For Monk we want Crit > DH > Det.
  - question: "\"What's BiS?\"/\"What stats should I put on my relic?\""
    answer: >-
      Check out the [BiS page
      here](/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/).


      The following Pastebin contains recommendations for BiS sets in all three Ultimate fights, containing both Relic/Non-relic sets

  - question: '"Twin Snakes falls off in my opener, is that normal?"'
    answer: Yep, Twin Snakes will fall off for a little bit during PB. This will
      happen multiple times.
