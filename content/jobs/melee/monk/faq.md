qna:
  - answer: Yes and no. Say for example you use Rockbreaker on three enemies, and it
      crits every enemy -- you will only gain one Chakra, as you can only gain
      one Chakra per weaponskill. However, if you have Brotherhood on and land a
      critical weaponskill, youâ€™ll gain two Chakra; one from the crit, and one
      from the effect of Brotherhood.
    question: Can I gain multiple Chakra from one weaponskill?
  - question: Which opener is better?
    answer: "It depends on your kill time. Check the guide. "
  - question: What's the point of Celestial Revolution?
    answer: A consolation prize for when you mess up your PB window. It's lower
      potency than the other two blitzes and single-target, meaning you never
      want to intentionally use this skill.
  - question: "Which is better for generating a Lunar Nadi in AoE, Rockbreaker or
      Shadow of the Destroyer? "
    answer: "Shadow of the Destroyer. Guaranteed crit > 20 potency "
  - question: Is Riddle of Earth 20% or 60% mitigation?
    answer: It's 20% flat mitigation.
  - question: Is there a way to separate my buffs so I can keep track of Leaden Fist
      easier?
    answer: "Yes there is. Go into your HUD Layout -> Click your buff bar -> Click
      the little gearbox button -> Select either Split Element into 3/4
      groups.\r

      Leaden Fist, Formless Fist, and Perfect Balance all appear on the
      Conditional Enhancements bar.\r

      Everything else is on the Enhancements bar."
  - question: Why no 1.94 BIS if I play at 60 FPS?
    answer: The shortest answer to this question I can give you is that the tooltip
      you see in game isn't strictly accurate to your GCD. Depending on your
      framerate, your GCD is going to be variably slower than what is displayed
      in-game. This isn't to say that "higher FPS value = better", far from it.
      Effectively every different GCD speed has different frame rates that are
      better or worse, the only reason we specifically advise not to run 1.94 at
      60 FPS is because 60 FPS is a very common value for people to be playing
      at (especially when you're considering console players) and it's extra bad
      for 1.94. Essentially if you play 1.94 GCD with 60 FPS, your GCD is
      actually at 1.95, which is pretty gross. If you aren't mitigating this via
      third party programs, running a 1.93 GCD is going to be better for you.

> *Is Double True Strike dead?*

As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.

> *What's with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?* 

With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK's higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.

> *What do non opener RoF windows look like?*

Similar to opener, you may not have Leaden Fist while going into it though.

> *Is Twin Snakes meant to drop for a bit?*

2 GCDs without twin snakes after each Perfect Balance window is intended.

> *What food is good?*

Depends on your stats, but the BiS uses Smoked Chicken.

> *Any recommendations for crafted gear/First week raiding gear melds?*

Crafted Exclusively: <https://etro.gg/gearset/ffcd0478-818d-45b2-83e9-7bcef5f75617>

Crafted with non-savage stuff dropped in and 1 DH meld to DET: <https://etro.gg/gearset/4b5883ff-8b9e-46fc-8fc3-62d255596e6d>

If you're considering getting the Emerald Weapon/Pants later, you may as well flip that one meld on the initial set.

> *Where can I try out changes to the rotation?*

Try the sim found in here: <https://discord.gg/M9BYeJN>

> *Why does the BiS have so many DET melds?*

Every time someone asks I add another DET meld to the BiS and therefore only the few people who notice contribute to the problem.\
(The real reason is stat tiering.)

> *Got a good visualization of the Rotation?*
