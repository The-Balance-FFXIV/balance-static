# Single Target GCDs

Monk has six core single-target GCDs:

|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002984_hr1.png) | **Pouncing Coeurl** is the upgraded version of **Snap Punch**, it has a potency of 310, or 460 when you have *Coeurl's Fury*, increasing to 370 and 520 respectively when executed from the flank. It can only be executed from Coeurl form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002547_hr1.png) | **Six Sided Star** is a GCD with a potency of 780, but double the recast of every other GCD. A situational skill, you'll either use it before running out of a big aoe, before a boss dies, or before a boss goes untargetable for whatever reason. It also applies a small movement speed buff for five seconds. In Dawntrail SSS also consumes all your Chakra with the same 80 potency per Chakra as The Forbidden Chakra, but shouldn't be used to replace The Forbidden Chakra or Enlightenment. Overall a very useful utility GCD. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002536_hr1.png) | **Form Shift** is a unique GCD, as it's not directly a part of our rotation, but it does enable our rotation. Form Shift grants the Formless Fist buff, which allows you to use any GCD and gain its additional form effects. Since this GCD does no damage, we only ever use it before pulling an enemy or during downtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# AoE GCDs

Monk has three core AOE GCDs, one for each of its forms:

|                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/action/215.png) | Opo-Opo form has **Arm of the Destroyer**, a circle AoE around you with 110 potency which increases to 120 potency when executed with its form bonus.                                                                 |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002979_hr1.png)              | Opo-Opo form also has **Shadow of the Destroyer**, the upgraded form of **Arm of the Destroyer**, a circle AoE around you with 120 potency which becomes a guaranteed critical hit when executed with its form bonus. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002544_hr1.png)              | Raptor form has **Four-Point Fury**, another circle AoE around you with 140 potency.                                                                                                                                  |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002529_hr1.png)              | Coeurl form has **Rockbreaker**, *another* circle AoE around you with 150 potency.                                                                                                                                    |

# The Form System

Forms are a concept unique to Monk, and is what separates it from standard combo-based melee jobs. Unlike other jobs that simply have combos that trigger each other in a static manner, there is considerable flexibility in how Monk advances through its forms. Each GCD is also enhanced when used in the correct form, meaning forms should be advancing forwards and not broken, otherwise the form will drop, reducing damage output.

Monks have three forms: Opo-Opo, Raptor, and Coeurl:

* In Opo-Opo form, Bootshine, Dragon Kick, Leaping Opo and Shadow of the Destroyer is enhanced. Using an Opo-opo GCD grants Raptor form.
* In Raptor form, True Strike, Twin Snakes, Rising Raptor and Four-point Fury is enhanced and usable. Using a Raptor GCD grants Coeurl form.
* In Coeurl form, Demolish, Snap Punch, Pouncing Coeurl and Rockbreaker is enhanced and usable. Using a Coeurl GCD grants Opo-opo form.

# Opening Inner Chakra

Chakra is the simpler of Monk's two job gauges.  Chakra can be stacked up to five times. At five stacks, it can be spent to execute one of the following oGCDs:

| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002535_hr1.png)                                         | The Forbidden Chakra | Upgraded version of **Steel Peak**, deals 400 potency to a single target.                                  |

There are multiple ways to generate Chakra.

When outside of combat, they generate five stacks of Chakra instantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/005000/005238_hr1.png) | Deep Meditation I & II are two job traits. Deep Meditation I grants an 80% chance of generating a Chakra upon landing a critical weaponskill. Deep Meditation II increases that 80% chance into a 100% chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002542_hr1.png) | Brotherhood has multiple effects, but specifically as to Chakra generation, upon execution, all party members within 30 yalms will gain the effect of Meditative Brotherhood for 20 seconds.  While this buff is active on an ally, every time they execute a weaponskill or a spell, there is a 20% chance of gaining a stack of Chakra. While the buff is active on yourself, you have a 100% chance to gain a Chakra each time you execute a weaponskill. |

# Beast Chakra

Beast Chakra is a new Monk job gauge in Endwalker, and hinges around the changes to Perfect Balance.

Perfect Balance has a similar effect as it did previously -- nullifying form requirements -- however now it has two charges and a 40s cooldown.  Upon executing a weaponskill, it grants a Chakra of the corresponding Form.  These Beast Chakra can now be spent on one of 4 new Blitz weaponskills. depending on the Chakra  accumulated.

| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002542_hr1.png) | **Brotherhood**     | An oGCD with a 120s CD. It increases damage of yourself and all nearby party members by 5% for 20 seconds, allows the opening of up to 10 chakra, and grants a 20% chance to generate a chakra when a party member lands a weaponskill, with that chance being 100% for yourself. We always want to use this skill when it best benefits our party members, alongside their own 120s buffs, and save two charges of Perfect Balance for this party burst. |
| ![](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000217_hr1.png) | **Perfect Balance** | Grants the same buff as Formless Fist, but for 3 gcds, and the following 3 gcds creates different outcomes for Masterful Blitz, discussed earlier on this page. This skill has multiple charges, so we can afford to let it cap over one charge. We want to use 1 charge for Riddle of Fire windows, and 2 charges for Riddle of Fire + Brotherhood windows.                                                                                              |

It increases healing received by you and all party members within 30y by 10%, which is quite a strong mitigation tool. Given that a lot of the shields in this game (Succor, Aspected Helios, etc.) are based on the amount of healing done, it means that Mantra can be used to provide both increased healing and greater shielding. You should discuss with your healers when to use it for maximum benefit.                 |
