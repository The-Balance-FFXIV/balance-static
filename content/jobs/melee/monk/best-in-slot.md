      As usual, any gear you get will change your current best set dractically,
      simply exchange and use the meld solver to remeld as you see fit. We do
      not use any normal raid pieces this time around. Here are some tips on
      planning your gear path during week 1 and prog:


      * Naturally, if you can get the Tome Weapon and Upgrade materials, this will result in the most dps for your party. Sets can be found in the link above.

      * Tome Head and Feet are good, you may want to use them in Week 1 depending on loot allocation.

      * If you get a full gear feed, tome ring can be good purchase as it will be the only crafted piece you still wear otherwise by the last floor.

      * When losing or gaining sks, make sure you reach your desired GCD again (usually 1.94) by remelding sks or food swapping (Caramel Popcorn and Nachos)

      * Try (over)melding sks in the last meld slots such that you save gil and can also easily exchange it needed (see above)

      As usual the ornate set is only if you can afford it, this set is the best
      on floor 1, the ornate allows us to buy 2 extra tome pieces instead of a
      body. One of which is not included in the savage bis (delays getting all
      tome pieces for bis by a week), but should be considered for week 1 prog.


      Alternative "fodder" tome pieces are feet.


      Tome Weapon sets can be found in the linked gearset sheet above.

      The basic week 1 set. This already acquires us all tome pieces for savage
      bis in 2 weeks of the tier.
