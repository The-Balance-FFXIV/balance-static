Viper follows the stat priority of: Critical Hit > Determination â‰¥ Direct Hit > Skill Speed. However, it is recommended to use the highest item level gear available to you, as it will give you more of your primary stat which will always result in a higher DPS gain than lower item level counterparts.

When melding with Materia it is advised to follow the same stat priority.
