  - question: Are Reawaken skills affected by Haste/Skill Speed? What speeds are
      VPRs GCDs?
    answer: "A﻿ll of Viper's GCDs are affected by both Haste and Skillspeed. Viper
      has a 15% haste buff that is upkept in its rotation. Vipe also has five
      different GCD speeds. Assuming no Skillspeed, this chart shows the speed
      of each category of GCD.


      | Type                    | No Haste | Haste |\r

      |-------------------------|----------|-------|\r

      | Generations             | 2.00     | 1.70  |\r

      | Reawaken                | 2.20     | 1.87  |\r

      | Dual Wield              | 2.50     | 2.12  |\r

      | Twinblade and Ouroboros | 3.00     | 2.55  |\r

      | Uncoiled Fury           | 3.5      | 2.97  |"
  - question: Does Reawaken have a cooldown?
    answer: N﻿o. You can enter it multiple times in a row without needing fillers.
  - question: Will I be able to double weave on high ping?
    answer: Y﻿es, almost all of Viper's double weaves are after long GCDs (2.55 or
      2.97s). Even someone with higher ping should be able to do them without
      clipping.
  - question: How many positionals does Viper have?
    answer: S﻿ix total, three flanks and three rear. Every single target dual wield
      combo will end in one positional, alternating each time. Every single
      target twinblade combo will have both a rear and flank positional, the
      order of which can be freely chosen each time assuming the order doesn't
      matter for buff upkeep.
  - question: When do I use Rattling Coil stacks?
    answer: These stacks should be used primarily to maintain uptime during a melee
      disconnect, otherwise the stacks can be spent during filler rotation.
  - question: What breaks VPR combos?
    answer: >-
      Dual wield combos are not broken by anything other than starting the AoE
      combo while in single target combo, and vice versa. 


      Twinblade combo is broken by any non-twinblade GCD with the exception of Writhing Snap and Uncoiled Fury. This means you cannot Reawaken during twinblade! Twinblade combos are also broken by starting the AoE version while in single target combo, and vice versa.
