# TENTATIVE Viper Leveling Guide

- - -

**THIS GUIDE WAS WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE FULL RELEASE OF DAWNTRAIL. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

This guide was written to inform players who are seeking to, or are currently levelling Viper. The guide aims to inform players about how to initially play as Viper, what gear they should use while levelling and where to find it, the key basics of the job, as well as some example openers for lower levels. If you are already a level 100 Viper and are looking for information pertaining to the job at level 100, please see the Basic Viper Guide.

# Introduction

Viper is the newest melee DPS job introduced in the Dawntrail expansion, and uses scouting gear and aiming accessories, the same as Ninja. The job focuses on building gauge for Reawaken, a fast-paced burst of attacks ending with a heavy hitting finisher. This gauge is generated by executing combos in either of Viper’s weapon configurations which it alternates between frequently. Viper also focuses on the upkeep of several buffs using the same combos it uses to generate gauge, so buff maintenance occurs naturally.

Once you obtain your job stone at level 80 after completing the quest “Insert Quest Name Here”, you will have access to numerous Viper skills, which will be discussed in detail further into the guide.

## How To Become A Viper

Viper is unlockable at level 80 for players who have purchased the Dawntrail expansion and have at least one combat job at level 80 or higher.

The quest to unlock Viper, \[quest name here], can be found in Ul'dah (x0.0, y0.0), from the NPC \[insert name here].

## Gearing

Viper is a Scouting class and thus it shares gear with Ninja and uses Aiming accessories.

As the job starts at level 80 only gear above level 80 will be discussed in this section. Gearsets for content below level 80, such as Ultimates like UCoB, will be expanded upon in \[insert section here].

### Level 80

It is recommended to purchase a combination of Edenmorn and Augmented Cryptlurker gear from Fathard in Eulmore (x:10.3, y:11.8). Keep in mind that this gear will get quickly replaced by dungeon gear from level 85 onwards.

### Level 90

It is recommended to purchase a combination of Ascension and Augmented Credendum gear from Khaldeen in Radz-at-Han (x: 10.8 y: 10.4). Keep in mind that this gear will get quickly replaced by dungeon gear from level 95 onwards.

### Level 100

Will update on Dawntrail release

### Stat Priority And Materia

Viper follows the stat priority of: Critical Hit > Determination > Direct Hit > Skill Speed. However, it is recommended to use the highest item level gear available to you, as it will give you more of your primary stat which will always result in a higher DPS gain than lower item level counterparts.

When melding with Materia it is advised to follow the same stat priority. Best in Slot gearsets can be found in #vpr_resources.

## Leveling Methods

Listed below are the methods believed to be the most optimal for leveling a job from level 80 to level 90, ordered by efficiency.

1. Spamming the highest level dungeon available with a premade four-person group, as this avoids queue times.
2. The Bozjan Southern Front. Due to EXP capping at level 80 values the EXP gains will be exponentially slower the farther from level 80 you get. No longer being worth it past level 85.
3. Eureka Orthos. 
4. Spamming dungeons with trusts.
5. Grinding FATEs while queuing for the highest level dungeons available.

# Job Basics

## Buffs

### Noxious Gnash

Is a targeted debuff that increases the damage taken by the applying Viper by 10%. This debuff is maintained with the use of either Dread Fangs or Dreadwinder in single-target, or Dread Maw and Pit of Dread in multi-target, and is applied or extended by 20 seconds to a maximum of 40 seconds. This should be maintained at all times.

### Hunter’s Instinct

A self-applied buff that increases Viper’s damage by 10%. This buff is maintained with the use of either Hunter’s Sting or Hunter’s Coil in single-target, and Hunter’s Bite or Hunter’s Den in multi-target. Using either of these skills will apply or extend Hunter’s Instinct by 40 seconds to a maximum of 40 seconds. This should be maintained at all times.

### Swiftscaled

Viper’s second self-applied buff that decreases weaponskill recast time and auto-attack delay by 15%. This buff is maintained with the use of either Swiftskin’s Sting or Swiftskin’s Coil in single-target, and Swiftskin’s Bite or Swiftskin’s Den in multi-target. Using either of these skills will apply or extend Swiftscaled by 40 seconds to a maximum of 40 seconds. This should be maintained at all times.

## Vipersight Gauge

The Vipersight Gauge is a HUD element in the shape of two swords connected by an ornate crest in the centre. The gauge indicates what your next action is in a doubleblade combo, and will guide you to the combo finisher corresponding to the buff you received from the previous finisher. If you have no buff then you can do any combo freely.

When the gauge has no glowing elements, as seen in the image below, it means you have no combo started so you can start with either Steel Fangs or Dread Fangs, neither of which will affect how the rest of the combo will play out.  It is important to note that both of these skills will turn into the next skill in the combo of the same

\
If one of the swords is glowing red, as seen in the image below, it means you are in the middle of a combo. Use the skill of the glowing side, or if both swords are glowing then you can push either skill. What skill you use will affect what combo finishers are available.

![](https://i.imgur.com/eKDIgl5.png)

\
If one of the swords is glowing blue, as seen in the image to the right, it means you are at the end of a combo. Use the skill of the glowing side to use a buffed combo finisher. If both sides are glowing then no buff is active so you can use either combo finisher.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4bxwKWa.png)

\
After you finish a combo you gain a buff for another combo of the opposite side. So if you ended a combo with a ‘Flank’ combo finisher the buff you receive will be for a ‘Hind’ finisher, and vice versa.

The Vipersight gauge also functions in the same way with the AOE combo.

It is important to note that both combo finishers after Hunter’s Sting will be ‘Flank’ finishers, and both combo finishers after Swiftskin’s Sting will be ‘Hind’ finishers. This causes the player to naturally alternate between Hunter’s Sting and Swiftskin’s Sting.

## Rattling Coil Gauge

Unlocked at level 82, the Rattling Coil gauge is attached to the Vipersight gauge in the form of three diamonds in the centre. These diamonds are greyed out but turn red for each Rattling Coil gained, to a maximum of three.

![](https://i.imgur.com/l7dMMze.png)

\
These Rattling Coils can be spent on Uncoiled Fury, a 500 potency ranged GCD, which is useful for maintaining uptime during melee disconnects.

## Serpent’s Offering Gauge

Unlocked at level 90, the Serpent’s Offering gauge is a HUD element with the appearance of a spherical flask being bitten by two snakes. This gauge indicates how much Serpent’s Offerings you currently have. This gauge can have a maximum of 100 Serpent’s Offerings, and 50 can be spent on Reawaken.

Serpent’s Offerings are gained by executing either a doubleblade combo finisher, or any twinblade combo GCD that isn’t the first one.

While the gauge is at zero the ‘flask’ will appear empty, however as Serpent’s Offerings are gained the ‘flask’ will fill up with a red liquid. Once the gauge reaches 50, enough for Reawaken, the liquid will turn blue and the gauge itself will periodically pulse blue to signify that Reawaken is able to be used.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9I6OwHX.png)

\
Once Reawaken is activated the gauge will change once again. The gauge will glow blue, and five glowing blue orbs will appear at the bottom, with a 30 second timer that will begin to count down immediately.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NEydUOr.png)

\
The glowing orbs are known as Anguine Tributes. Each Reawaken GCD costs one Anguine Tribute to execute, with the exception of the finisher, Ouroboros, consuming all remaining Anguine Tributes.

The timer signifies the duration of the ‘Reawakened State’, however consuming all Anguine Tribute stacks will end the ‘Reawakened state’ before this timer reaches zero.

## Filler

Filler is defined by the sections of our rotation between our two minute burst windows. Since these burst windows are approximately 20 seconds long every two minutes, most of our time will be spent doing filler.

Make sure between your burst windows you:

* Use Dread Fangs to refresh Noxious Gnash when it has less than 20 seconds of duration remaining, and Dreadwinder will not be used during that time.
* Maintain both the Hunter’s Instinct and Swiftscaled buffs at all times.
* Use one Reawaken and spend all Anguine Tribute stacks once between every two minutes.
* Perform the doubleblade combo respective of the finisher buff currently active.
* Use Dreadwinder stacks on cooldown (unless you’re about to enter a two minute window).
* Spend Rattling Coils between combos, ensuring no buffs fall off.

It is important to note that Uncoiled Fury is a damage loss until level 92, before it has follow-up oGCDs. Before level 92 players should only use Uncoiled Fury to maintain uptime when necessary.

## Levels 96-99

Will update on Dawntrail release

## Levels 100

Will update on Dawntrail release

## Multi-Target (3+) Rotation

Viper’s multi-target rotation is fairly identical to its single-target rotation. Both the doubleblade combo and the twinblade combo have an AOE variant that follows similar logic as their single-target counterparts. So outside of swapping to the AOE variants in multi-target scenarios Viper has no other multi-target optimization.
