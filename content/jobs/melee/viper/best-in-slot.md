    description: This set avoids pentamelding and replaces some of the crafted gear
      with Extreme and Normal Raid i710 pieces to cut down on costs. This set
      will be just fine if you want to get into savage but aren't going for an
      early kill. Replace these pieces with higher item level pieces as you get
      them.

      crit-centric sets due to the lack of powerful oGCDs that benefit from
      crit.
