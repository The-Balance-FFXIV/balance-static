      either 2.11 or 2.10 GCD speeds.\

      \

      **Q.** ***What GCD speed should I choose?***\

      **A.** Which speed we choose is largely fight dependent. The difference between 2.10, 2.11, and 2.12 is within damage variance outside of fight specific reasons to use one or another. Choose which one you are most comfortable with. If you are unsure which to go with, 2.10 is a solid all around choice.
