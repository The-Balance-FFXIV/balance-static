  - patch: "7.0"
    description: Job added to the game with patch 7.0 -- Dawntrail. For a full
      overview, please visit the [official page by Square
      Enix](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/viper/), which will be live
      shortly after launch.
  - patch: "7.01"
    description: All single target damage oGCDs had their range increased from 3y to 5y.
  - patch: "7.05"
    description: >-
      Noxious Gnash removed. 


      Dread Fangs, Dread Maw, Dreadwinder, and Pit of Dread renamed to Reaving Fangs, Reaving Maw, Vicewinder, and Vicepit respectively. 


      Several abilities had their potency increased to account for the removal of Noxious Gnash, and some were buffed even further than to make up for the difference. This resulted in a ~2.3% DPS buff for VPR compared to 7.01.\
