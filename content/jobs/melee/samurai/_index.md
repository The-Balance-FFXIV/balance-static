At a glance a Samurai's GCD structure is simplistic and easy to digest - there are three different combos you execute after one another in order to collect their corresponding "Sen". As such it's a job that's easy to get into and do moderately well with even if your knowledge of the higher arts isn't as refined yet. At higher levels there are two resources to manage - Sen and Kenki - and understanding how to manipulate them in order to have a smooth rotation which lines up with party buffs and encounter mechanics is what makes Samurai stand out as job with one of the highest skill ceilings in the game.
