  - patch: "7.05"
    description: >-
      Pressing Meikyo Shisui grants us the Tendo buff, which transforms Midare
      Setsugekka into a very high potency skill called Tendo Setsugekka, as well
      as its follow-up Tendo Kaeshi Setsugekka. Tendo also applies to Tenka
      Goken if you're doing the AoE rotation. Due to this high potency, we try
      as much as possible to use Meikyo prior to our burst windows so that we
      can fit them inside of buffs for some great contribution.


      Using Midare Setsugekka or Tenka Goken gives us the "Tsubame-Gaeshi Ready" buff, which lets us use Kaeshi: Setsugekka or Kaeshi: Goken at any point after the Iaijutsu, giving us a great deal of flexibility handling mechanic downtime or holding onto them for buff windows for some extra contribution.


      Skill revamps, Traits, and a new Ability called Zanshin, which we can use after pressing Ikishoten.
