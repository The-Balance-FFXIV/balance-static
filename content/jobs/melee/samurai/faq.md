  - question: Is X better than Y for me?
    answer: >-
      * For weapons: item level (iLvl)/weapon damage (WD) wins, regardless of
      substats.

      * For armor: iLvl usually wins, unless 5 materia slots.

      * For same-iLvl pieces: substat itemization can be in your favor or not depending on the rest of your gear and stat tiering.


      When in doubt, use the Gear Planner - only here can you get an accurate answer for **your** setup!
  - question: Samurai has positionals?!
    answer: >-
      Samurai has two positionals:


      ➜ Gekko from the rear/back.


      ➜ Kasha from the flank/side.


      • Each one when successfully landed grants a 50 potency bonus to the base combo potency. Given the overall usage of ~7 positionals every 60s, this equates to a 350 potency gain every minute.


      • Remember to use your True North buff when you encounter mechanics that make you unable to properly execute your positionals.



      **Executing positionals correctly is an essential part of any melee DPS job!**

  - question: Is my ping too high to play Samurai?
    answer: High ping is bad, but not unplayable if you know how to work around it.
      Choose a slower GCD range and/or stick to single weaves if you notice
      consistent GCD clipping after double/iai-weaving.
  - question: When is Higanbana worth using?
    answer: It takes ~45s (depending on server ticks) for Higanbana to outdamage
      Midare which is the point for Higanbana to be 100% worth doing. Depending
      on your killtime or if it grants you an extra usage of Shoha it may be
      worthwhile to use Higanbana even if it would not tick for 45s or more.
  - question: "Why is there a Hissatsu: Gyoten in the opener?"
    answer: "Hissatsu: Gyoten is the same potency per kenki as Hissatsu: Shiten. If
      we didn't use it in the opener, we would leave the sequence with 10
      remaining kenki, which could've been used inside of our pot window to
      squeeze out as much damage as we can."

> Samurai has positionals?!

The level 52 trait Kenki Mastery introduces positional bonuses for Gekko and Kasha, granting 5 extra Kenki.

* Gekko from the rear/back.
* Kasha from the flank/side.
* 5 Kenki equals 64+ potency after level 62 and 100+ potency before level 62.
* There are 7-8 Gekko/Kasha every 60s and fulfilling their positional requirements is a potency gain of 448-512 per minute.

Executing positionals correctly is an essential part of any melee DPS job.
