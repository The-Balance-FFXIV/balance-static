## Level 50
[Level 50 Opener](http://ffxivrotations.com/1ndy)

Keep buffs up, reapply your Higanbana as close to zero as possible, Midare goes brrrrrr. 

## Level 52

You learn Kenki Mastery I, which introduces the Kenki gauge and positionals on Gekko/Kasha. Use Kaiten exclusively on Iaijutsu (Higanbana > Midare).

## Level 60

[Level 60 Opener](http://ffxivrotations.com/2rqm)

Use the above and read Level 52 for the rest.

## Level 62

You learn Kenki Mastery II. Begin to Kaiten all Iaijutsu, use excess Kenki on Shinten, use Level 70 Openers. 

[Level 70 Bana 1st Opener](http://ffxivrotations.com/2r8w)  
[Level 70 Midare 1st Opener](http://ffxivrotations.com/2r8x)

Reserve Midare 1st for encounters that require you to move exactly as you need to cast Higanbana with Bana 1st opener (e.g. UCoB Twintania).

## Level 76

You learn Tsubame-gaeshi. Use this exclusively after Midare Setsugekka (ST) or Tenka (AoE), never after Higanbana.

## Level 78

You learn Enhanced Jinpu and Shifu. Congratulations! You can now study up on the max level rotation and practice it on Innocence.
