      exchange for an easier looping rotation, as well as slightly better
      flexibility with mechanic downtime.

      Sets for these fights are community-sourced through use of XIVGear. In the
      case of UCOB, UWU, TEA and DSR, you do not NEED those sets to clear -
      they're mostly to squeeze out the most damage possible. Special thanks to
      Niche, Lars and Boxer for helping with making these.
