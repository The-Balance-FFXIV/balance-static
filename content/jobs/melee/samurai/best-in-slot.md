    description: The 2.15 GCD Savage BiS set is the highest simulated DPS output of
      all current Savage BiS gear sets. As it does not need to spend any melds
      into Skill Speed, it is able to maximize the amount put into other more
      beneficial substats. This gear set is also recommended for those newer to
      the job or with higher ping, as more time between GCDs is more lenient for
      double weaves or being unsure of your next button in the rotation.

    description: The 2.07 GCD Savage BiS set is roughly 0.5% below 2.15 in simulated
      DPS and may cause some issues with weaving depending on player ping. In
      exchange for this, it extends the rotation by one to 29 GCDs per minute,
      allowing for more flexibility with mechanic downtime to keep your burst
      phases aligned with your party.

    description: The 2.00 GCD Savage BiS set is also roughly 1% below 2.15 in
      simulated DPS, and it nearly guarantees issues with Iai and double weaves
      without the use of third party software. The benefits of this set are that
      the rotation is extended one further to 30 GCDs per minute, and has a
      faster playstyle similar to Monk.
