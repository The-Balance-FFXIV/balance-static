Dragoon is a very static melee DPS job. You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance.
