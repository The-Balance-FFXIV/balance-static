# Dragoon Opener and Rotation

The primary use of the Opener is to prepare your cooldown alignment for the rest of the encounter. With our new job design, it’s possible that we’ll actually have fight-specific openers down the stretch, and they’ll all be added here!

These openers have not been too thoroughly tested as of yet, so please take them with a grain of salt, and if you discover anything that flies counter to what we have listed here, please don’t hesitate to ask!

## Standard Opener

The backbone of ten GCDs in sequence will - in general - never be changed, but the two blocks of skills (**Buffs** and **Attacks**) can be shuffled around within their respective slots if necessary to accommodate specific encounter timings.

The default order for the **Attacks** puts Spineshatter Dive as a buffer skill between High Jump and Geirskogul in order to try and prevent future situations where the two are ready at the exact same time.

## Levelling

The basic GCD backbone of the rotation does change as you level:\
`64-80`: Raiden Thrust Disembowel Chaos Thrust Wheeling Thrust Fang and Claw-Raiden Thrust Vorpal Thrust Full Thrust Fang and Claw Wheeling Thrust\
`58-63`: True Thrust Disembowel Chaos Thrust Wheeling Thrust-(True Thrust Vorpal Thrust Full Thrust Fang and Claw)x2\
`56-57`: True Thrust Disembowel Chaos Thrust-(True Thrust Vorpal Thrust Full Thrust Fang and Claw)x2\
`50-55`: True Thrust Disembowel Chaos Thrust-(True Thrust Vorpal Thrust Full Thrust)x3\
`26-49`: True Thrust Disembowel-(True Thrust Vorpal Thrust Full Thrust)x4\
`18-25`: True Thrust Disembowel-(True Thrust Vorpal Thrust)x6
