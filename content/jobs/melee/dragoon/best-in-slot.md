    description: Choosing this 2.50 set is highly recommended. It is much easier to
      play, more comfortable and will thus likely yield better results in
      practice. It is also identical to the Reaper BiS.

    description: "In case you prefer a slightly faster set. Can be preferable in
      some fights due to better GCD alignment but is much harder to play
      optimally. Requires you to get nine GCD buff windows for equal performance
      to the 2.50 set. "

# Ultimates Best-in-Slot Discussion

If you're planning to do one of the level 70 Ultimate encounters, you should just sync down current gear. If you wear anything with an Item Level higher than 418 for UCoB or 470 for UWU, you will maximize the two stats on the gear. Just aim primarily for pieces with Critical Hit Rate and Direct Hit Rate. Both fights are perfectly well-suited for a 2.50 GCD.

The BiS for TEA is below. This is up-to-date as of 5.55.\
