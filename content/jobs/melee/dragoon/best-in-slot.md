      Recommended for everyone because of the simple and comfortable playstyle
      with a 2.50 GCD.


      This set is also identical to the Reaper 2.49/2.50 set.

    description: "In case you prefer a slightly faster set. Can be preferable in
      some fights due to better GCD alignment but is much harder to play
      optimally. Requires you to get nine GCD buff windows for equal performance
      to the 2.50 set. "

      !!Example set!! You have many options for each gear slot. Synced gear has
      to be at least i470. Please refer to etro or ariyala for other options.

      Materia does not matter in synced gear.

# Ultimates Best-in-Slot Discussion

If you're planning to do one of the level 70 Ultimate encounters, you should just sync down current gear. If you wear anything with an Item Level higher than 418 for UCoB or 470 for UWU, you will maximize the two stats on the gear. Just aim primarily for pieces with Critical Hit Rate and Direct Hit Rate. Both fights are perfectly well-suited for a 2.50 GCD.

The BiS for TEA is below. This is up-to-date as of 5.55.\
