      The strongest simmed set is the 2.42s  omni caster set, followed closely
      by the high sps sets and other slower crit sets.The lowest of the bunch is
      the 2.36s crit set, but only trails by ~0.2% from the top set, so remains
      plenty viable.


      Choose your set based on your preferred speed, compatibility with other casters, or whatever else.
