      By swapping the gloves for appropriately melded tome gloves, this set can
      share gear with the PCT/RDM BiS sets as well as SMN omni-caster BiS sets.


      Has speed melds on weapon to facilitate this compatibility with other caster sets.

      Overall, choose your set based on your preferred speed, compatibility with other casters, or whatever else. The damage difference between sets is fairly minimal, particularly between sets using the Chaotic gear vs tome/raid gear.
