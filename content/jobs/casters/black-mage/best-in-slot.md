# BiS:

"Speed 3655 SpS Tier (Relic)":\
<https://etro.gg/gearset/1c64d9a9-892b-48a8-b7d1-f760839d659c>  

"Crit 2030 SPS Tier (Relic)":\
<https://etro.gg/gearset/b470c4c6-6f4a-47c8-8162-52ac09494e02>  

"SMN/RDM-Friendly BiS": (can use the SMN/RDM BiS without swapping melds)\
Use the "Speed 3655 SpS" Tier set for BLM, and use SMN/RDM BiS on the other casters. Shared pieces between the sets have no meld conflicts.

Thanks to incoherent#0649 for the provided relic sets!\
Please see <http://bit.ly/BLMGear> for additional sets, including non-relic BiS sets

"TEA BiS": (Please look at the sheet below under "Patch 5.0+" for more options)

* High Speed BiS (Relic): <https://etro.gg/gearset/02a81644-076f-4a5c-b959-d58fbbb86411> 
* High Crit BiS (Relic): <https://etro.gg/gearset/dd1144c3-11cd-439b-b835-f5aefab1e755>

# Pros/Cons of the BiS:

* "High Speed BiS": Very slightly higher average output, but less variance. Has some volatility in terms of MP ticks in UI
* "High Crit BiS": Very slightly lower average output, but higher variance. Does not run into similar MP tick issues as with the SpS set

In summary: Both sets are exceedingly comparable in estimated output, so pick a set with a SpS that you feel most comfortable with and can perform well with

# Gear Tools:

Relative Gear Comparison sheet: <http://bit.ly/BLMGear>\
This usually lists a few other sets for different levels of SpS, as well as old sets and can be used to min-max your own sets according to your group's raid buffs.

Jaha's Gear Planner: <http://bit.ly/Gear-Planner>\
Similar to Ariyala, but with the built-in functionality to model your DPS. You can use this to compare two gear sets easily.
