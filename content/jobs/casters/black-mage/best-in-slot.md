      The strongest simmed set is the 2.42s set, followed closely by the high
      sps sets and other slower crit sets.The lowest of the bunch is the 2.36s
      crit set, but only trails by ~0.2% from the top set, so remains plenty
      viable.


      Choose your set based on your preferred speed, compatibility with other casters, or whatever else. Note: currently a known issue where the tome wrist is "Healing" instead of "Casting". Stats are still correct, issue is only visual for now.
