# Openers

Openers should put abilities on cooldown, fit strong spells within buff windows, and minimize clipping. All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Potion of Intelligence available.

## **Standard 5+7 Opener**

![Standard 5+7 Opener](/img/jobs/blm/standard-5-7-opener.png "Standard 5+7 Opener")

<br>The standard opener for BLM. This opener skips a **Despair** cast pre-**Manafont** as well as a **Paradox** cast post-**Manafont** in order to cast 12 total **Fire IV** casts (5 before and 7 after **Manafont,** thus the name "5+7"), enabling two uses of **Flare Star**.

The initial **Fire III** cast should start around 4 seconds prepull (to land at the same time the boss is pulled). **High Thunder** should be refreshed just before raid buffs are falling off, which may shift depending on spell speed and party buff timing.

Additional notes:

* The second charge of **Ley Lines** can be flexibly used at any point after the opener, with the goal of using it during a window where its full duration can be used.
* **Triplecast** and **Swiftcast** usage is fairly flexible as needed in the opener for movement, but should still ideally be weaved after an instant-cast spell. At very low spell speeds, **Swiftcast** will come off cooldown to be available for the Umbral Ice I **Blizzard III** usage as pictured.
* This opener does not generate a Firestarter proc due to skipping the **Paradox** in Astral Fire. As a result, in order to consistently generate the proc for stronger reentry into Astral Fire III you should continue to use **Paradox** as your first spell in Astral Fire until at least the next **Manafont** cycle.

## **Alternative Single-Target Flare Opener**

![](/img/jobs/blm/alternative-st-flare-opener.png)

<br>This alternative opener leverages **Flare** to generate sufficient Astral Soul stacks for a second **Flare Star** in the opener. The initial **Fire III** cast should start around 4 seconds prepull (to land at the same time the boss is pulled). **High Thunder** should be refreshed just before raid buffs are falling off, which may shift depending on spell speed and party buff timing.\
\
While a minor loss compared to the Standard opener, this opener allows for casting **Paradox** post-**Manafont**. This generates a Firestarter proc for use in the following Astral Fire cycle, allowing for more flexible **Paradox** usage in subsequent cycles compared to the Standard opener.

If you were to use the Standard opener and would want or otherwise need to regain this flexibility by casting **Fire III** from Umbral Ice III instead of the recommended **Astral Fire I** -> **Paradox** -> **Firestarter**, you will lose less from swapping to this Alternative Opener to begin with.

Additional notes:

* The second charge of **Ley Lines** can be flexibly used at any point after the opener, with the goal of using it during a window where its full duration can be used.
* **Triplecast** and **Swiftcast** usage is fairly flexible as needed in the opener for movement, but should still ideally be weaved after an instant-cast spell.
* The placement of **Xenoglossy** is flexible in the opener but should ideally be used within the raid buff window.
* This opener can sometimes be referred to as "Potato Rotato" as homage to an old Stormblood BLM optimization nicknamed "Potato Rotato", similarly leveraging **Triplecast** for single-target **Flare** and Umbral Ice I **Blizzard III**.
