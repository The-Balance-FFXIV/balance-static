  - question: What is Umbral Soul used for?
    answer: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build
      back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you
      can Thunder III -> Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a
      fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not
      use Umbral Soul during uptime.
  - question: How do I use Despair?
    answer: It's a final nuke you use at the end of your AF cycle after you've done
      all your Fire IV casts. Minimum cost for Despair is 800 MP.
  - question: Is Lucid Dreaming useless on BLM?
    answer: Outside of niche optimization, it is not used on BLM.
  - question: What do I use Xenoglossy for?
    answer: Xeno is mainly used as a weaving and movement tool, or as filler in UI
      if T3 doesn't need to be applied. Apart from its utility aspect, it can
      also be used instead of other spells under raid buffs. Just make sure to
      never waste a use of it by overcapping Polyglot.
  - question: What's the stat/meld priority?
    answer: Always maximize iLvl. After that, SpS to comfort > Crit/DH > Det. All
      stats are tiered, so exact melds depend on total stats. Keep in mind that
      SpS is not just a stat for comfort, since BLM scales very well with it.
      You might meld a "worse" stat over a "better" one due to your gearset or
      tiers. Use the Relative Gear Comparison sheet to min-max melds if desired.
  - question: Well, what's a comfy SpS?
    answer: If you wanna go fast, go fast. If you wanna go slow, go slow. The
      rotation works at both extremes. A popular, yet mostly arbitrary number to
      aim for is ~2k+ SpS, but go with what works for you. Feel free to use one
      of the sets in the aforementioned Relative Gear Comparison sheet.
  - question: Which BiS is better for high ping/newer players?
    answer: Either set would be plenty fine for both high ping and for newer
      players. They each have their nuances to get used to, but are plenty
      viable and easy enough to work with. Pick whichever one sounds the most
      interesting to you and go from there.
  - question: Why does the "High Speed" BiS not meld crit?
    answer: Due to a lack of Crit + SpS pieces of gear at cap, a higher speed set
      ends up with a low amount of Crit naturally. As a result, Crit generally
      becomes less valuable of a meld compared to other options.
  - question: What stats should I put on my relic?
    answer: If you’re using a high SpS set, you will likely want to use more SpS +
      DH with some Det. High-crit set will generally lean towards a stat spread
      closer to Crit + SpS + DH/Det. You can min-max using the [5.X relative
      gear comparison sheet if desired.](http://bit.ly/BLMGear)
  - question: What's the UCoB/UwU BiS?
    answer: >-
      If you just aim to clear you can use synced gear just fine. If you want to
      speedrun old Ultimates use the following:


      UwU: i375 head/hands/feet. i470+ everything else.

      UCoB: i430+ weapon. i345 everything else.


      A Resistance weapon with capped stats will beat a synced weapon. Use the [4.X relative damage calculator sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnu8G8p_zC0DVyDz_FNs04tBmUiBq8wRUpxcZf1JOQw/) to min-max your own sets.
  - question: If I have 2.4k MP left and my Astral Fire phase is about to run out,
      do I use Fire -> Despair, or only Despair?
    answer: You use solely Despair, since it's the better option on average.
  - question: I'm using No B4 Opener and Xeno isn't ready in time. What do I do?
    answer: Above 2.4k SpS, skip the Xeno and go straight to Astral Fire after B4.
      If you're at full MP, do a normal rotation. If not, do a 4x F4 -> Despair
      rotation. This is fairly immobile and may not work in every fight. You can
      also try using LL one GCD later. Between 2k and 2.4k SpS, simply skip
      Swift and Xeno will be ready. Alternatively, consider the Modified JP
      opener.
  - question: Sharpcast (or any oGCD) is available, but I don’t have anything to use
      to weave it. Do I clip to use it?
    answer: Generally, you will want to delay use until the next available weaving
      window. Situationally, if it means potentially losing any uses or you have
      an otherwise strong reason to keep it more strictly on CD, then you can
      clip it (and try to figure out a way to avoid that clip next pull).
  - question: What macros does BLM use?
    answer: None, except for macros for Aetherial Manipulation and Sprint. You can
      find an example in the [5.X BLM
      guide.](/jobs/casters/black-mage/5-x-blm-guide)
