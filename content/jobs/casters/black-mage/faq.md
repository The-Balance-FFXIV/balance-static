  - question: Should I use every Thunderhead buff I get?
    answer: No, prioritize refreshing the DoT when it is falling off (less than
      three seconds remaining). This means that you will not use every
      Thunderhead buff, but since most of the damage is on the DoT portion,
      efficient upkeep on the DoT is more important than maximizing Thunderhead
      usage.
  - question: How do I use Umbral Soul?
    answer: Umbral Soul is a downtime spell, used to build up to and maintain Umbral
      Ice III with three Umbral Hearts as well as get back to full MP. When you
      can actively hit a target, you should not be using Umbral Soul. Since it
      can only be used in Umbral Ice, you may need to Transpose from Astral Fire
      before you can use it.
  - question: Is it okay to refresh High Thunder early if I need it for movement?
    answer: If you have no other movement options in the given situation, using the
      proc early is better than losing out on the GCD entirely. However, try to
      plan better for next time you’re in the situation to have something
      available for movement, allowing you to refresh the DoT with more proper
      timing.
  - question: Do I do anything to align with raid buffs/maximize damage dealt within
      raid buffs?
    answer: Often it will be advantageous to align pot uses with the rest of the
      party. oGCD abilities if used roughly on cd will often keep some semblance
      of alignment naturally with other buffs. If you can spare any polyglot
      stacks for Xenoglossy for use in raid buffs that you won’t need elsewhere
      to help keep uptime, it’s a pretty reasonable consideration to do so.
      Otherwise, BLM will generally fit good spells within raid buffs regardless
      of alignment–prioritize uptime and solid rotational choices first and
      foremost.
  - question: Should I use Paradox in Umbral Ice even if I don't need it for
      weaving/movement?
    answer: Yes, Paradox is a strong spell and should generally be used every Umbral
      Ice cycle.

# Q: What is Umbral Soul used for?

A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -> Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.

# Q: How do I use Despair?

A: It's a final nuke you use at the end of your AF cycle after you've done all your Fire IV casts. Minimum cost for Despair is 800 MP.

# Q: Is Lucid Dreaming useless on BLM?

A: Outside of niche optimization, it is not used on BLM.

# Q: What do I use Xenoglossy for?

A: Xeno is mainly used as a weaving and movement tool, or as filler in UI if T3 doesn't need to be applied. Apart from its utility aspect, it can also be used instead of other spells under raid buffs. Just make sure to never waste a use of it by overcapping Polyglot.

# Q: What's the stat/meld priority?

A: Always maximize ilvl. After that, SpS to comfort > Crit/DH > Det. All stats are tiered, so exact melds depend on total stats. Keep in mind that SpS is not just a stat for comfort, since BLM scales very well with it. You might meld a "worse" stat over a "better" one due to your gearset or tiers. Use the Relative Gear Comparison sheet above to min-max melds if desired.

# Q: Well, what's a comfy SpS?

A:  If you wanna go fast, go fast. If you wanna go slow, go slow. The rotation works at both extremes. A popular, yet mostly arbitrary number to aim for is ~2k+ SpS, but go with what works for you. Feel free to use one of the sets in the aforementioned Relative Gear Comparison sheet.

# Q: Which BiS is better for high ping/newer players?

A: Either set would be plenty fine for both high ping and for newer players. They each have their nuances to get used to, but are plenty viable and easy enough to work with. Pick whichever one sounds the most interesting to you and go from there.

# Q: Why does the "High Speed" BiS not meld crit?

A: Due to a lack of Crit + SpS pieces of gear at cap, a higher speed set ends up with a low amount of Crit naturally. As a result, Crit generally becomes less valuable of a meld compared to other options.

# Q: What stats should I put on my relic?

A:  If you’re using a high SpS set, you will likely want to use more SpS + DH with some Det. High-crit set will generally lean towards a stat spread closer to Crit + SpS + DH/Det. You can min-max using the [5.X relative gear comparison sheet if desired.](http://bit.ly/BLMGear)

# Q: What's the UCoB/UwU BiS?

A:  If you just aim to clear you can use synced gear just fine. If you want to speedrun old Ultimates use the following:

UwU: i375 head/hands/feet. i470+ everything else.
UCoB: i430+ weapon. i345 everything else.

A Resistance weapon with capped stats will beat a synced weapon. Use the [4.X relative damage calculator sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnu8G8p_zC0DVyDz_FNs04tBmUiBq8wRUpxcZf1JOQw/) to min-max your own sets.

# Q: If I have 2.4k MP left and my Astral Fire phase is about to run out, do I use Fire -> Despair, or only Despair?

A: You use solely Despair, since it's the better option on average.

# Q: I'm using No B4 Opener and Xeno isn't ready in time. What do I do?

A: Above 2.4k SpS, skip the Xeno and go straight to Astral Fire after B4. If you're at full MP, do a normal rotation. If not, do a 4x F4 -> Despair rotation. This is fairly immobile and may not work in every fight. You can also try using LL one GCD later. Between 2k and 2.4k SpS, simply skip Swift and Xeno will be ready. Alternatively, consider the Modified JP opener.

# Q: Sharpcast (or any oGCD) is available, but I don’t have anything to use to weave it. Do I clip to use it?

A: Generally, you will want to delay use until the next available weaving window. Situationally, if it means potentially losing any uses or you have an otherwise strong reason to keep it more strictly on CD, then you can clip it (and try to figure out a way to avoid that clip next pull).

# Q: What macros does BLM use?

A: None, except for macros for Aetherial Manipulation and Sprint. You can find an example in the [5.X BLM guide.](LINK)
