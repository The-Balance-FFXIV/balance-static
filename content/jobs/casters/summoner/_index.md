Summoner is a caster DPS that juggles pet abilities, damage-over-time effects, an Aetherflow gauge, and more. The rotation features a powerful burst window, able to summon the mighty Demi-Bahamut, Demi-Phoenix, and Solar Bahamut, which also deal a large amount of area-of-effect damage. With powerful and consistent bursts, Summoner is able to contribute a lot of damage into party buffs. It also brings an impressive suite of utility to a raid progression setting, with its own party damage buff, a powerful on-demand shield on a short cooldown, and its very own resurrection ability.
