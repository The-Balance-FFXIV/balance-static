  - question: Is SMN good/fun/interesting/etc.?
    answer: Reception is pretty mixed overall. Some really enjoy it, some do not.
      Overall it is much simpler and much more approachable than Summoner was in
      Shadowbringers. However, don't trust the opinions of other people on the
      internet for how the job feels. Play it yourself and form your own
      opinions!
  - question: Okay, but how good is it compared to other DPS?
    answer: "Short answer: It is totally fine. Unless you are a hardcore speedrunner
      or optimizer, Summoner is good enough for all content.\r

      \r


      If you're really interested in job balance, go to the \\#bot_spam
      channel on the Balance Discord and use the command !faq ewbalance."
  - question: How do I know which opener to use?
    answer: You want to reference your raid composition in deciding. If you are
      heavy in 15s buffs, the fast Garuda opener is better. For a list of jobs
      by buff duration, visit the \#smn_resources channel on the Balance Discord
      for more information.
  - question: How/when do I use Ruin 4?
    answer: Prioritize using it whenever you can make use of the cleave or need the
      mobility. Otherwise, use it wherever you wish, as long as it is not inside
      a Demi summon. Don’t waste it by letting Further Ruin drop.
  - question: I'm starting a fight with both a Demi summon up AND primal gems. What
      do I do?
    answer: "It depends on the time you end the phase you're fighting or your
      killtime. Here's the general decision making flowchart:


      \r

      \r

      Ask yourself: Will I lose a use of a demi by delaying?\\\r

      If yes -> do not delay demi\\\r

      If no -> ok to use primals and delay demi\\\r

      If I don’t know -> do not delay demi"
  - question: I'm using the SpS set but now my demis don't align with burst windows.
      What do I do?
    answer: That's normal and intended. If you're running a SpS build, your demis no
      longer line up with your party's burst. This is fine, because you will be
      gaining more demi phases over the course of a fight. Do NOT delay your
      demis by inserting lots of Ruin 3s in these builds. At that point, you are
      just running a strictly worse Crit build, and it is bad.
  - question: What loot should I get from normal mode raids?
    answer: "For a general use set that minimizes spell speed we recommend you
      follow this priority:\\\r

      \r

      Week 1 - Gloves and Feet\\\r

      Week 2 - Pants


      \r

      \r

      For a set that is heavier on SPS, we recommend you follow this
      priority:\\\r

      \r

      Week 1 - Head + Ring\\\r

      Week 2 - Chest"
  - question: What BiS set do I choose?
    answer: The general Crit focused set (that's the 2.48 set) is likely to be
      better in most content, so if you are not interested in adapting multiple
      sets to different niche content, it's better to choose the 2.48 general
      use Crit set. Speed build sets are only listed for those that really want
      to go fast, or optimize to particular fight timelines in a similar vein as
      the Extreme trial sets listed.
