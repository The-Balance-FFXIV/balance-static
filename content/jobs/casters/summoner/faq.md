  - question: Is Summoner good/fun/interesting/etc.?
    answer: Reception is pretty mixed overall. Some really enjoy it, some do not.
      Overall it is much simpler and much more approachable than Summoner was in
      Shadowbringers. However, don't trust the opinions of other people on the
      internet for how the job feels. Play it yourself and form your own
      opinions!
  - question: Okay, but how good is it compared to other DPS?
    answer: "Short answer: It is totally fine. Unless you are a hardcore speedrunner
      or optimizer, Summoner is good enough for all content.\r

      \r


      If you're really interested in job balance, currently Summoner is
      the lowest parsing caster available of the four, slightly behind Red
      Mage."
  - question: How/when do I use Ruin IV?
    answer: Prioritize using it whenever you can make use of the cleave or need the
      mobility. Otherwise, use it wherever you wish, as long as it is not inside
      a Demi summon. Don’t waste it by letting Further Ruin drop.
  - question: I'm starting a fight with both a Demi summon up AND primal gems. What
      do I do?
    answer: "It depends on the time you end the phase you're fighting or your kill
      time. Here's the general decision making flowchart:


      \r

      \r

      Ask yourself: Will I lose a use of a Demi by delaying?\\\r

      If yes → do not delay Demi.\\\r

      If no → ok to use primals and delay Demi.\\\r

      If I don’t know -> do not delay Demi."
  - question: What loot should I get from normal mode raids?
    answer: For the upcoming savage tier, with four weeks from the release of normal
      to savage raids, the fundamental tome order doesn't matter. You have the
      ability to have a full set of normal raid equipment with several pieces of
      tome gear. To that end, the best loot is the loot that you need to
      upgrade, preferably while maintaining an appropriate GCD.
  - question: My team is asking me to delay my burst and Searing Light for buffs.
      What do I do?
    answer: >-
      1. Always use Searing Light with your team’s buffs, no matter what. **If
      they delay it, you delay it.**

      2. Hold Festers/Necrotize whenever possible to place as many in buffs. If you can afford to delay Energy Drain without losing a use to place four Festers/Necrotizes in buffs, you should.

      3. **You should almost never delay your demi-summon for your team’s buffs.** It will require you to use extra Ruin IIIs, and each extra Ruin III is a significant potency loss. The cost of aligning your burst in buffs is higher than the potency you would gain by aligning with buffs. There is sometimes, very rarely, an argument to use one or two extra Ruin IIIs, at most. Any more than that quickly becomes mathematically impossible to gain enough potency from buffs to offset what you would lose.
