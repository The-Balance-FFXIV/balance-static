# Introduction 

Welcome! This page is written to assist you throughout your leveling journey and provide insight on how the Summoner job will evolve from level one to level 80.  Summoner may appear as a bit of a “unique” job with a lot of moving parts and multiple avenues of attacking enemies.  

Throughout this leveling guide, we will provide you with a basic fundamental understanding of each spell that you will unlock, as well as provide some quick rotation priorities and visualization examples. Our goal is to break things down into simple and easy-to-understand concepts to help you piece together the various moving parts that Summoner’s kit is built from.  

We will also break it down into smaller leveling “sections" to allow you to focus on priorities that are specific to each section, then slowly incorporate new priorities as you move to the next. We hope you enjoy your leveling and learning experience with Summoner, and be sure to have fun with it!

## Levels 1 - 10

Beginning at level one will give you access to Ruin as your base Global Cooldown (GCD) option. You should cast Ruin as often as you can on your target.\
\
Level two will bring Summon Carbuncle, allowing you to summon a carbuncle to your side.  This carbuncle is only responsible for casting two support actions, one of which you will unlock immediately.\
\
Radiant Aegis will also unlock at level two and is the first support action that can be used from your carbuncle. Radiant Aegis will command your carbuncle to cast a substantial shield onto yourself for survivability purposes.

Physick will unlock at level four as a GCD heal option. At this level range, Physick is a useful spell if additional healing is required; however, it is not the primary focus for Summoners to use during combat.  

Upon reaching level six, you’ll unlock Aethercharge. Aethercharge is the prequel to your trance spells that will be unlocked much later, increasing the potency of your Ruin (and later Outburst) GCDs and providing elemental arcanum that can be used for special summons.

Level six will also unlock Summon Ruby, the first of these special summons. Activating Summon Ruby will summon a Ruby Carbuncle to cast its ultimate ability, Glittering Ruby, as well as provide you with two fire attunement stacks to be spent with special actions that will be made available. \
\
Gemshine also unlocks at level six as the first special action to be used with your pet summons. With each summon that is used, Gemshine will be infused with elemental attunement, allowing you to cast an infused ability that is stronger than the original Ruin spells.\
\
When Summon Ruby is activated, this means Gemshine will turn into the Ruby Ruin spell.  Each Ruby Ruin will consume one of your fire attunement stacks, dealing high damage to your target, but with a longer cast time.  

At level ten you will unlock Energy Drain and Fester. Energy Drain is an off-Global Cooldown (oGCD) ability that will provide you with Aetherflow Gauge, which can be spent on unique oGCD abilities. Fester is the first of these abilities, dealing significant single target damage to your target.

### Quick Rotation Goals:

* Cast Ruin as much as possible on your target
* Activate Aethercharge whenever it becomes available for additional damage gains on Ruin
* Use Summon Ruby when you have Ruby Arcanum available and spend your fire attunement stacks on Ruby Ruin.
* Weave Energy Drain whenever it becomes available and spend your Aetherflow Gauge on Fester.
* Use Radiant Aegis or Physick if you need additional survivability (can be important while playing solo or doing quests).  

## Levels 11 - 20

At level 12 you will unlock Resurrection. Resurrection allows you to raise downed party members, making it a very important utility action.

Level 15 will unlock Summon Topaz, your second special summon. Activating Summon Topaz will summon Topaz Carbuncle to cast its ultimate ability, Glittering Topaz, as well as provide you with four earth attunement stacks. \
\
Topaz Ruin will also be made available when Summon Topaz is activated.\
\
From this point you will now have two special summons to play with, allowing you to chain Summon Ruby and Summon Topaz consecutively once their arcanum is made available.

### Quick Rotation Goals:

* Cast Ruin as much as possible on your target.
* Activate Aethercharge whenever it becomes available for additional damage gains on Ruin.
* Use Summon Ruby when you have Ruby Arcanum available and spend your fire attunement stacks on Ruby Ruin.
* Use Summon Topaz when you have Topaz Arcanum available and spend your earth attunement stacks on Topaz Ruin.
* Weave Energy Drain whenever it becomes available, spend your Aetherflow Gauge on Fester.
* Use Radiant Aegis or Physick if you need additional survivability (can be important while playing solo or doing quests).  

## Levels 21 - 30

Level 22 will unlock Summon Emerald, your third special summon. Activating Summon Emerald will summon Emerald Carbuncle to cast its ultimate ability, Glittering Emerald, as well as provide you with four wind attunement stacks. 

Emerald Ruin will also be made available when Summon Emerald is activated.

From this point you will now have all three summons to play with, allowing you to chain Summon Ruby, Summon Topaz, and Summon Emerald consecutively once their arcanum is made available.

| Summon            | Gemshine     | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Ruby Carbuncle    | Ruby Ruin    | A GCD cast with a long cast time.               |
| Topaz Carbuncle   | Topaz Ruin   | An instant cast GCD.                            |
| Emerald Carbuncle | Emerald Ruin | An instant cast GCD with a shorter recast time. |

\
\
Reaching level 26 will introduce the capability of attacking multiple enemies at once, allowing you to choose between using single target actions, or area-of-effect (AoE) actions.

At level 26 you will unlock Outburst, your AoE filler GCD. Use Outburst anytime you are fighting three or more enemies in close proximity to each other. \
\
You will also receive Precious Brilliance at level 26, the second special action to be used by your summons. Just like Gemshine, Precious Brilliance will be infused with elemental attunement, allowing you to cast abilities that will be stronger than your base Outburst.\
\
While you only have Carbuncle summons at this moment, your Precious Brilliance will transform into the following abilities:

| Summon            | Precious Brilliance | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Ruby Carbuncle    | Ruby Outburst       | An AoE GCD cast with a long cast time.              |
| Topaz Carbuncle   | Topaz Outburst      | An instant cast AoE GCD.                            |
| Emerald Carbuncle | Emerald Outburst    | An instant cast AoE GCD with a shorter recast time. |

Level 30 will introduce the first upgrade to your summons, with Summon Ruby transforming into Summon Ifrit. Summon Ifrit provides the same elemental attunement as Summon Ruby, but instead will summon Ifrit-Egi to cast Inferno, a much stronger ultimate ability. 

Level 30 will also provide an upgrade to your Ruin ability, upgrading it to Ruin II.  This upgrade will also include your Gemshine abilities: Ruby Ruin II, Topaz Ruin II, and Emerald Ruin II.

### Quick Rotation Goals:

* Cast Ruin, and later Ruin II, when fighting one or two enemies.
* Cast Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Activate Aethercharge whenever it becomes available for additional damage gains on Ruin.
* Use Summon Ifrit when you have Ruby Arcanum available. Spend your fire attunement stacks on Ruby Ruin II when fighting one to two enemies, or Ruby Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Use Summon Titan when you have Topaz Arcanum available. Spend your earth attunement stacks on Topaz Ruin II when fighting one or two enemies, or Topaz Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Use Summon Garuda when you have Emerald Arcanum available. Spend your wind attunement stacks on Emerald Ruin II when fighting one or two enemies, or Emerald Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Weave Energy Drain whenever it becomes available, spend your Aetherflow Gauge on Fester.
* Use Radiant Aegis or Physick if you need additional survivability (can be important while playing solo or doing quests).  

## Levels 31 - 50

Level 35 will introduce your second primal upgrade, with Summon Topaz transforming into Summon Titan.  Summon Titan provides the same elemental attunement as Summon Topaz, but instead will summon Titan-Egi to cast Earthen Fury, a much stronger ultimate ability.

Upon reaching level 40, you will unlock Painflare. Painflare is another option for spending Aetherflow Gauge, dealing damage to your target and any other nearby targets.\
\
With Painflare unlocked, you will now have the choice to spend Aetherflow Gauge for single target or AoE purposes.

Level 45 will then introduce the third primal upgrade, with Summon Emerald transforming into Summon Garuda. Summon Garuda provides the same elemental attunement as Summon Emerald, but instead will summon Garuda-Egi to cast Aerial Blast, a much stronger ultimate ability.

With all of your summons now upgraded, remember that this does not change the core of your rotation in any way. Upgraded summons just provide additional damage with their ultimate abilities. Elemental attunement will remain consistent.  

### Quick Rotation Goals:

* Cast Ruin, and later Ruin II, when fighting one or two enemies.
* Cast Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Activate Aethercharge whenever it becomes available, for additional damage gains on Ruin
* Use Summon Ifrit when you have Ruby Arcanum available. Spend your fire attunement stacks on Ruby Ruin II when fighting one or two enemies, or Ruby Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Use Summon Titan when you have Topaz Arcanum available. Spend your earth attunement stacks on Topaz Ruin II when fighting one or two enemies, or Topaz Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Use Summon Garuda when you have Emerald Arcanum available. Spend your wind attunement stacks on Emerald Ruin II when fighting one or two enemies, or Emerald Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Weave Energy Drain whenever it becomes available. Spend your Aetherflow Gauge on Fester for single target damage, or Painflare for AoE damage.
* Use Radiant Aegis or Physick if you need additional survivability (can be important while playing solo or doing quests).  

## Levels 51 - 60

Energy Siphon will become available at level 52 as another option for refreshing Aetherflow Gauge. Once you have unlocked this ability, you should use it when fighting three or more targets.  

At level 54, you will receive your final ruin upgrade, with Ruin II upgrading to Ruin III.  This upgrade will also include your Gemshine abilities: \
\
Ruby Ruin II —> Ruby Ruin III

Topaz Ruin II —> Topaz Ruin III

Emerald Ruin II —> Emerald Ruin III

Once you reach level 58, you will unlock Dreadwyrm Trance. Dreadwyrm Trance will upgrade from Aethercharge, providing additional effects along with providing elemental arcanum.\
\
Instead of increasing the potency of your Ruin and Outburst GCDs, Dreadwyrm Trance will provide you with two new unique GCDs:

Ruin III will temporarily transform into Astral Impulse.\
Outburst will temporarily transform into Astral Flare.

Astral Flow will be introduced at level 60. Astral Flow is a unique ability, providing a special ability throughout the duration of your trance or primal summon. At level 60, you’ll have access to your first Astral Flow ability with Deathflare upon activating your Dreadwyrm Trance.

### Quick Rotation Goals:

* Cast Ruin II, and later Ruin III, when fighting one or two enemies.
* Cast Outburst when fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.
* Activate Dreadwyrm Trance whenever it’s available. Cast Astral Impulse if fighting one or two targets, and cast Astral Flare if fighting three or more enemies in close proximity.

* Weave Energy Drain whenever it becomes available. Spend your Aetherflow Gauge on Fester for single target damage or Painflare for AoE damage.
* Use Radiant Aegis if you need additional survivability (can be important while playing solo or doing quests).

## Levels 61 - 70

\
Further Ruin and Ruin IV will be unlocked at level 62. Each time you use Energy Drain or Energy Siphon you will receive a proc of Further Ruin, allowing you to use Ruin IV. This proc will last for 60 seconds, giving you plenty of time to use it during your rotation.\
\
Upon reaching level 66, you will unlock Searing Light. Searing Light is the second support ability available from your carbuncle. Activating Searing Light will command your carbuncle to apply a buff to yourself and all party members to deal 3% additional damage.

Once you reach level 70, your Dreadwyrm Trance will be upgraded to Summon Bahamut. This upgrade will maintain the previous effects of Dreadwyrm Trance, but will now include your first demi summon with Demi-Bahamut.\
\
Demi-Bahamut will provide two distinct attacks while spawned:

* Enkindle Bahamut: Will command Demi-Bahamut to cast his ultimate ability, Akh Morn.
