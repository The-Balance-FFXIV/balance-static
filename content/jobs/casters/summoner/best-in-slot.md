    description: All builds are viable and competitive with each other. Crit builds
      are better in full uptime scenarios and better at aligning with buffs, but
      the speed SMN playstyle is still a viable option if you prefer it. Please
      note the exact melds are tentative to change based on future testing, but
      the pieces are concrete for the sets.

    description: "This set is our **preliminary thought** on BiS for UWU. It is not
      necessarily the absolutely best set you can possibly make, but it is our
      best current guess based on what we know right now. The goal is to get
      seven Astral Impulses per Bahamut and spam as many Bahamuts as possible.\r

      \r

      They also follow with the disclaimer that **you do not need the
      exact BiS shown here to clear an ultimate.** Even post stat squish, the
      DPS checks appear quite lenient.


      \r

      \r

      You can also swap any piece of gear for another that has the same
      combination of stats provided it is above the minimum ilvl to fully sync
      (500 for UWU).

      **If you are playing Summoner in level 70 content, Emerald Ruin is
      less PPS than Ruin 3.** Emerald Ruin is only worth it if you would not
      otherwise get a Ruin 3 (for example, if the boss is phasing) or if it
      otherwise allows better alignment. You can still use it for emergency
      movement as well.


      It is possible to make a Crit/SpS focused set as well, but from our
      sims and math it appears worse overall than focusing on Det/DH. This may
      be different in a composition with heavy Crit buffs. The math has not been
      fully mapped out yet, so please take these as what they are: our
      **preliminary thoughts**."
