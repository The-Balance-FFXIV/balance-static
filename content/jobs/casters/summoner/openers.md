## Openers

### Titan First Opener

The below opener is the general go to opener for summoner and uses Titan as the first primal. Since the 6.1 changes, we can now use Searing Light in Bahamut, and choose to do so after the Bahamut GCD to avoid using a "dead" GCD in our buff. You can choose to omit the precast Ruin III and use Bahamut at 0s as well. This may be an optimization strategy for particular fight timelines or encounters where the gained one second on cycle progression may matter.[﻿](/img/jobs/smn/smnopener_0000_general.png)

### Garuda First Opener

The below opener uses Garuda as the first primal, prioritizing Swiftcast to fit Slipstream into your party's raid buffs. This is a gain when your group is heavy in 15s buffs, as a Swiftcasted Slipstream will barely fit into the end of these buffs. The general rule of thumb is two 15 second buffs outweigh one 20 second buff. 

You can choose to omit the precast Ruin III and use Bahamut at 0s as well. This may be an optimization strategy for particular fight timelines or encounters where the gained one second on cycle progression may matter.[﻿](/img/jobs/smn/smnopener_0001_fastgaruda.png)
