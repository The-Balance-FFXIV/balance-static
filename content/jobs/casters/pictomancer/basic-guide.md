**Basic Overview**

Let’s go over how the individual pieces of the Pictomancer kit fit together. We can broadly group the job’s mechanics into these subsystems:

* **Basic Combos and Palette Gauge**
* **Subtractive Palette**
* **Creature Motifs**
* **Weapon Motif**
* **Landscape Motif** 

**Basic Combos and Palette Gauge**

Pictomancer has two primary combo foundations: “Palette” and “Motif”. The “Palette” foundation consists of actions that generate Palette Gauge and Paint Charges, whereas “Motif” paints multiple Motifs on Canvas to life as powerful Muses. Both foundations are used to deal damage as a Pictomancer.

Let’s start with spell combos and the **Palette Gauge** of Pictomancer.

**Basic Combo**

<br>

**Fire in Red** > **Aero in Green** > **Water in Blue** is Pictomancer’s basic combo. The basic combo and its AoE counterpart generates 25 **Palette Gauge** and a **White Paint** charge. **Palette Gauge** is the main payoff for executing a basic combo and White Paint is used to cast **Holy in White**, the main resource used for movement. 

The **Palette Gauge** can hold a maximum of 100 Gauge and five Charges of **White Paint.** 

Let’s talk about the main payoff for executing the Basic Combo. 

**Subtractive Palette**

Once you have 50 **Palette Gauge** you can execute **Subtractive Palette** and use an enhanced combo (that also generates **White Paint**). 

Subtractive will convert a stack of **White Paint** to **Black Paint**. If a charge of **White Paint** is not available, then the next one obtained will be automatically converted to **Black Paint**. Only one charge of **Black Paint** can be held at once and it occupies the same slot on the gauge as the **White Paint** it took the place of. 

**Black Paint** allows us to use **Comet in Black**, a significantly stronger spell than **Holy in White**. **Comet in Black** can also be used for movement in a similar way to **Holy in White**. 

**Subtractive Combo** 

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Blizzard in Cyan</strong>

   </td>
   <td><strong>Stone in Yellow</strong>
   </td>

   <td><strong>Thunder in Magenta</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

   </td>

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTThunderInMagenta.png)

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

The Subtractive Combo is significantly stronger than the basic combo. However both the Subtractive Combo and **Comet in Black** have a longer recast time than normal GCDs. This gets reduced under the effect of **Hyperphantasia** during **Starry Muse,** but we will go over that later. 

Successfully executing the Subtractive Combo and its AoE counterpart won’t grant **Palette Gauge**, but it will grant a charge of **White Paint**. 

**Motifs and Muses**

Next, let’s talk about the other foundation of Pictomancer gameplay: **Motif** and **Muse**. 

A **Motif** is a hardcast spell with a long cast time (three seconds) with an even longer recast time (four seconds) that prepares powerful effects called **Muses**. The **Motif** cast in itself does no damage and when the cast is stored on the **Canvas**, a special type of Gauge available to Pictomancer. 

Pictomancer has three slots on their **Canvas** which each store a unique type of **Motif**: the **Creature Motif**, **Weapon Motif**, and **Landscape Motif**. 

A **Muse** requires and consumes its related **Motif** to perform powerful off-global abilities. In the case of **Creature Motifs**, the next **Creature Motif** cannot be used until the previous **Creature Motif** has been consumed by its related **Muse**. 

Now, let’s talk about each type of **Motif** and its related **Muse.** 

**Creature Motifs**

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTCreatureMotif.png)

<br>

![](/img/jobs/pct/motif-and-muse-order-pct.jpg)

<br>

There are four **Creature Motifs** that must be used in the order of **Pom** > **Wing** > **Claw** > **Maw**. **Creature Motifs** grant the ability to use **Living Muses**. 

**Creature Motif Order:**

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

**Living Muses** are all 1000 potency off-global damage abilities and share a 40 second charge cooldown with a maximum of three charges. The **Wing** and **Maw Living Muses** (second and fourth **Muses**) also grant the ability to use **Portraits**. A **Portrait** is an off-global ability with an even higher potency. **Wing Muse** grants the ability to use the **Mog of the Ages**, while **Fanged Muse** grants the ability to use **Portrait of the Madeen**. 

**Weapon Motif**

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTWeaponMotif.png)

<br>

![](/img/jobs/pct/image47.png)

<br>

Currently there is only one **Weapon Motif:** the **Hammer Motif**. 

**Hammer Motif** grants the ability to use **Striking Muse**.

**Striking Muse** has a cooldown of 60 seconds with two charges. When used, it grants the ability to use what we’ll call the “Hammer Combo”.

The Hammer Combo consists of three spells: **Hammer Stamp** > **Hammer Brush** > **Polishing Hammer.** 

Each Hammer Combo spell is a guaranteed critical direct hit. 

**Landscape Motif**

![](/img/jobs/pct/starry-sky-motif-and-muse-pct-jpeg.jpg)

<br>

Currently there is only one **Landscape Motif:** the **Starry Sky Motif**.

**Starry Sky Motif** grants the ability to use **Starry Muse.**

**Starry Muse** is our 2-minute buff. In addition to a 5% party-wide damage up, it also grants the player: 

* The ability to use **Star Prism**.
* A free use of **Subtractive Palette**.
* Five faster casts and recasts on spells affected by **Hyperphantasia** while within the bounds of the area drawn by **Starry Muse**. 
* After five of these casts have been made, the player gets an instant cast **Rainbow Drip** with reduced recast time, roughly equal to a standard 2.5s GCD.
