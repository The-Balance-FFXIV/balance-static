# **Basic Overview**

Let’s go over how the individual pieces of the Pictomancer kit fit together. We can broadly group the job’s mechanics into these subsystems:

* **Basic Combos and Palette Gauge**
* **Subtractive Palette**
* **Creature Motifs**
* **Weapon Motif**
* **Landscape Motif** 

## **Basic Combos and Palette Gauge**

Pictomancer has two primary combo foundations: “Palette” and “Motif”. The “Palette” foundation consists of actions that generate Palette Gauge and Paint Charges, whereas “Motif” paints multiple Motifs on Canvas to life as powerful Muses. Both foundations are used to deal damage as a Pictomancer.

Let’s start with spell combos and the **Palette Gauge** of Pictomancer.

### **Basic Combo**

   <td><strong>Aero in Green</strong>

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

**Fire in Red** > **Aero in Green** > **Water in Blue** is Pictomancer’s basic combo. The basic combo and its AoE counterpart generates 25 **Palette Gauge** and a **White Paint** charge. **Palette Gauge** is the main payoff for executing a basic combo and White Paint is used to cast **Holy in White**, the main resource used for movement. 

The **Palette Gauge** can hold a maximum of 100 Gauge and five Charges of **White Paint.** 

Let’s talk about the main payoff for executing the Basic Combo. 

### **Subtractive Palette**

Once you have 50 **Palette Gauge** you can execute **Subtractive Palette** and use an enhanced combo (that also generates **White Paint**). 

Subtractive will convert a stack of **White Paint** to **Black Paint**. If a charge of **White Paint** is not available, then the next one obtained will be automatically converted to **Black Paint**. Only one charge of **Black Paint** can be held at once and it occupies the same slot on the gauge as the **White Paint** it took the place of. 

**Black Paint** allows us to use **Comet in Black**, a significantly stronger spell than **Holy in White**. **Comet in Black** can also be used for movement in a similar way to **Holy in White**. 

### **Subtractive Combo**

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Blizzard in Cyan</strong>

   </td>
   <td><strong>Stone in Yellow</strong>
   </td>

   <td><strong>Thunder in Magenta</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

   </td>
   </td>
   <td>

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTThunderInMagenta.png)

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

The Subtractive Combo is significantly stronger than the basic combo. However both the Subtractive Combo and **Comet in Black** have a longer recast time than normal GCDs. This gets reduced under the effect of **Hyperphantasia** during **Starry Muse,** but we will go over that later. 

Successfully executing the Subtractive Combo and its AoE counterpart won’t grant **Palette Gauge**, but it will grant a charge of **White Paint**. 

## **Motifs and Muses**

Next, let’s talk about the other foundation of Pictomancer gameplay: **Motif** and **Muse**. 

A **Motif** is a hardcast spell with a long cast time (three seconds) with an even longer recast time (four seconds) that prepares powerful effects called **Muses**. The **Motif** cast in itself does no damage and when the cast is stored on the **Canvas**, a special type of Gauge available to Pictomancer. 

Pictomancer has three slots on their **Canvas** which each store a unique type of **Motif**: the **Creature Motif**, **Weapon Motif**, and **Landscape Motif**. 

A **Muse** requires and consumes its related **Motif** to perform powerful off-global abilities. In the case of **Creature Motifs**, the next **Creature Motif** cannot be used until the previous **Creature Motif** has been consumed by its related **Muse**. 

Now, let’s talk about each type of **Motif** and its related **Muse.** 

### **Creature Motifs**

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTCreatureMotif.png)

<br>

![](/img/jobs/pct/motif-and-muse-order-pct.jpg)

<br>

There are four **Creature Motifs** that must be used in the order of **Pom** > **Wing** > **Claw** > **Maw**. **Creature Motifs** grant the ability to use **Living Muses**. 

**Creature Motif Order:**

   <td><strong>Maw Motif</strong> grants <strong>Fanged Muse </strong>which grants<strong> Retribution of the Madeen</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

**Living Muses** are all 1000 potency off-global damage abilities and share a 40 second charge cooldown with a maximum of three charges. The **Wing** and **Maw Living Muses** (second and fourth **Muses**) also grant the ability to use **Portraits**. A **Portrait** is an off-global ability with an even higher potency. **Wing Muse** grants the ability to use the **Mog of the Ages**, while **Fanged Muse** grants the ability to use **Portrait of the Madeen**. 

### **Weapon Motif**

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTWeaponMotif.png)

<br>

![](/img/jobs/pct/image47.png)

<br>

Currently there is only one **Weapon Motif:** the **Hammer Motif**. 

**Hammer Motif** grants the ability to use **Striking Muse**.

**Striking Muse** has a cooldown of 60 seconds with two charges. When used, it grants the ability to use what we’ll call the “Hammer Combo”.

The Hammer Combo consists of three spells: **Hammer Stamp** > **Hammer Brush** > **Polishing Hammer.** 

Each Hammer Combo spell is a guaranteed critical direct hit. 

### **Landscape Motif**

![](/img/jobs/pct/starry-sky-motif-and-muse-pct-jpeg.jpg)

<br>

Currently there is only one **Landscape Motif:** the **Starry Sky Motif**.

**Starry Sky Motif** grants the ability to use **Starry Muse.**

**Starry Muse** is our 2-minute buff. In addition to a 5% party-wide damage up, it also grants the player: 

* The ability to use **Star Prism**.
* A free use of **Subtractive Palette**.
* Five faster casts and recasts on spells affected by **Hyperphantasia** while within the bounds of the area drawn by **Starry Muse**. 
* After five of these casts have been made, the player gets an instant cast **Rainbow Drip** with reduced recast time, roughly equal to a standard 2.5s GCD.

# **General Gameplay Flow**

So, how does this all play out? Pictomancer takes resource banking to the extreme.

We want to prep our strong abilities like **Muses** and **Portraits** for 2-minute buff windows, while also finding efficient ways to spend our **Palette Gauge** and prep **Motifs**. As with all other jobs, our primary priorities should be maximizing GCD uptime, taking care not to lose cooldown usages or overcap on **Palette Gauge**.

We want to use **Motifs** and the **Subtractive Combo** during periods of low movement, as they have long cast times. 

Going into a 2-minute buff window, we want to make sure **Striking Muse** and **Starry Sky Muse** are both prepared to be used. We also want either **Wing** or **Maw Muse** prepared as well. All of these **Muse** preparations require us to get our long casts out of the way during convenient times. For example, during times where low movement is required, or during downtime. 

**There are a few caveats to remember which will grant us great flexibility in setting up sequences on Pictomancer:**

1. It is important to remember that our Basic Combo isn’t exactly a true combo. Because the **Aetherhues** buff lasts 30 seconds, we can interrupt the Basic Combo with other spells and still come back to it. For example, we can use **Fire in Red** > **Pom Motif** > **Hammer Motif** > **Aero in Green**  > **Starry Sky Motif** > **Water in Blue** and it would still count as a valid Basic Combo. 
2. The Hammer Combo is also not a true combo, as we have no other combos with the special text “**Combo Action”** to interrupt it. This means that we can also use other spells in between Hammer spell casts. For example, we can use **Hammer Stamp** > **Blizzard in Cyan** > **Stone in Yellow** > **Thunder in Magenta** > **Hammer Brush** > **Polishing Hammer** if we so desired. 
3. Because the **Subtractive Combo** shares the same **Aetherhues** buff as the **Basic Combo**, we can also use **Subtractive Palette** in the middle of a Basic Combo. For example, we could use **Fire in Red** > **Aero in Green** > **Subtractive Palette** > **Thunder in Magenta** > **Blizzard in Cyan** > **Stone in Yellow** > **Water in Blue** as a valid sequence. Because we are not losing any subtractive combo casts, this is not a DPS loss. 
4. While the **Starry Muse** damage buff and buff windows in general only last 20 seconds, it is important to remember that the other buffs like **Inspiration** and **Subtractive Spectrum**, granted by **Starry Muse**, last 30 seconds. This means that we do not need to fulfill all buff conditions within the 20s buff window itself. This is important, as there are powerful sequences we can perform that cram additional potency into the buff window. This will also delay less important personal kit buffs and effects until after the 20s buff window is finished, leaving 10s of personal kit buffs remaining.
5. **Subtractive Palette** technically grants the **Monochrome Tones** buff, which converts **White Paint** to **Black Paint** instead of a direct conversion. What this means is that if the player does not possess a **White Paint** charge, the next **White Paint** gained will automatically be converted to a **Black Paint** charge at that time.
6. While a **Black Paint** charge is active, **Holy in White** cannot be used. This is an important limitation for buff window set-ups that rely on **Comet in Black**.  \
   For example, if **Comet in Black** must be cast as the first GCD in buffs, or if the set-up needs to use two **Comet in Black** casts in the 20s buff window. 
7. The buffs granted by **Striking Muse** last 30 seconds. This means a Hammer Combo does not need to be used immediately after **Striking Muse** is used. This grants us additional flexibility for buff windows to use Hammer Combo in buff windows without drifting the **Striking Muse** cooldown. **Striking Muse** cannot be used again until the previous hammer combo is finished. 

## **Movement**

As touched upon in the previous section, we want to use our long cast spells such as **Motifs** and Subtractive Combo spells during periods of low movement. Spell combos will grant us **Holy in White** and **Comet in Black** resources to use during periods of high movement.

Preferably, the **Hammer Combo** and **Comet in Black**  should be used over **Holy in White** in terms of instant casts for movement, assuming the fight has low enough allowable movement. This is because **Holy in White**  is a very slight DPS loss, as it fills up space where we could have used the Basic or **Subtractive Combo** instead. However, this is often not possible when fights have more movement than those spells and our regular fast casts can cover. **Do not sacrifice GCD uptime trying to minimize usage of Holy in White.** This is something that should only be considered for extremely low movement fights.

**Outside of movement, the most important aspect of Holy in White usage is adjusting GCD timelines to get the ideal entrance into buff windows.** Care should be taken not to overfocus on generic potency per second averages, and instead to examine specific sequence setups in optimized scenarios. 

We should aim to stretch our movement resources by trying to abuse **Smudge** as often as possible. If it will cause mechanical execution issues, do not use **Smudge** in an unsafe or unnecessary way. Because **Smudge** has such a low cooldown and has a movement speed buff attached to it, we have much greater mobility than our instant cast number would suggest. 

## **Downtime**

We want to aim to swiftcast **Rainbow Drip** on the last hit before phase transitions, or when the boss is about to die. The long recast time and long cast time are mitigated in these circumstances, making it a hefty gain over most GCDs. 

We also want to aim to use **Motifs** during downtime if possible. As the **Motifs** have no potency, preparing them will allow us to use **Muses** that can deal damage when we return to combat. For this reason, Pictomancer is very strong in fights with frequent downtime, such as Dragonsong’s Reprise (Ultimate).

## **Defensive Utility**

This is a short overview on how Pictomancer’s unique defensive utilities work. 

Pictomancer has two shield abilities that share a cooldown: **Tempera Coat** and **Tempera Grassa**.

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTTemperaCoat.png)

<br>

**Tempera Coat** has a base cooldown of 120 seconds and grants a shield equal to 20% of your maximum HP. If this shield is broken, the cooldown is reduced by 60 seconds, effectively becoming a 60 second cooldown. 

![](/img/jobs/pct/PCTTemperaGrassa.png)

<br>

**Tempera Grassa** will “spread” your shield, replacing your single target shield and granting the entire party a shield equal to 10% of their maximum HP. If this version of the shield is broken, its cooldown will be reduced by 30 seconds, effectively becoming a 90 second cooldown.
