**General Gameplay Flow**

So, how does this all play out? Pictomancer takes resource banking to the extreme.

We want to prep our strong abilities like **Muses** and **Portraits** for 2-minute buff windows, while also finding efficient ways to spend our **Palette Gauge** and prep **Motifs**. As with all other jobs, our primary priorities should be maximizing GCD uptime, taking care not to lose cooldown usages or overcap on **Palette Gauge**.

We want to use **Motifs** and the **Subtractive Combo** during periods of low movement, as they have long cast times. 

Going into a 2-minute buff window, we want to make sure **Striking Muse** and **Starry Sky Muse** are both prepared to be used. We also want either **Wing** or **Maw Muse** prepared as well. All of these **Muse** preparations require us to get our long casts out of the way during convenient times. For example, during times where low movement is required, or during downtime. 

**There are a few caveats to remember which will grant us great flexibility in setting up sequences on Pictomancer:**

1. It is important to remember that our Basic Combo isn’t exactly a true combo. Because the **Aetherhues** buff lasts 30 seconds, we can interrupt the Basic Combo with other spells and still come back to it. For example, we can use **Fire in Red** > **Pom Motif** > **Hammer Motif** > **Aero in Green**  > **Starry Sky Motif** > **Water in Blue** and it would still count as a valid Basic Combo. 
2. The Hammer Combo is also not a true combo, as we have no other combos with the special text “**Combo Action”** to interrupt it. This means that we can also use other spells in between Hammer spell casts. For example, we can use **Hammer Stamp** > **Blizzard in Cyan** > **Stone in Yellow** > **Thunder in Magenta** > **Hammer Brush** > **Polishing Hammer** if we so desired. 
3. Because the Subtractive Combo\*\* **shares the same** Aetherhues **buff as the Basic Combo, we can also use** Subtractive Palette **in the middle of a Basic Combo. For example, we could use** Fire in Red **\>** Aero in Green **\>** Subtractive Palette **\>** Thunder in Magenta **\>** Blizzard in Cyan **\>** Stone in Yellow **\>** Water in Blue\*\* as a valid sequence. Because we are not losing any subtractive combo casts, this is not a DPS loss. 
4. While the **Starry Muse** damage buff and buff windows in general only last 20 seconds, it is important to remember that the other buffs like **Inspiration** and **Subtractive Spectrum**, granted by **Starry Muse**, last 30 seconds. This means that we do not need to fulfill all buff conditions\*\* \*\*within the 20s buff window itself. This is important, as there are powerful sequences we can perform that cram additional potency into the buff window. This will also delay less important personal kit buffs and effects until after the 20s buff window is finished, leaving 10s of personal kit buffs remaining.. 
5. **Subtractive Palette** technically grants the **Monochrome Tones** buff, which converts **White Paint** to **Black Paint** instead of a direct conversion. What this means is that if the player does not possess a **White Paint** charge, the next **White Paint** gained will automatically be converted to a **Black Paint** charge at that time.
6. While a **Black Paint** charge is active, **Holy in White** cannot be used. This is an important limitation for buff window set-ups that rely on **Comet in Black**.  \
   For example, if **Comet in Black** must be cast as the first GCD in buffs, or if the set-up needs to use two **Comet in Black** casts in the 20s buff window. 
7. The buffs granted by **Striking Muse** last 30 seconds. This means a Hammer Combo does not need to be used immediately after **Striking Muse** is used. This grants us additional flexibility for buff windows to use Hammer Combo in buff windows without drifting the **Striking Muse** cooldown. **Striking Muse** cannot be used again until the previous hammer combo is finished. 

**Movement**

As touched upon in the previous section, we want to use our long cast spells such as **Motifs** and Subtractive Combo spells during periods of low movement. Spell combos will grant us **Holy in White** and **Comet in Black** resources to use during periods of high movement.\*\* \*\*

Preferably, the\*\* **Hammer Combo** **and** Comet in Black **should be used over** Holy in White **in terms of instant casts for movement, assuming the fight has low enough allowable movement. This is because** Holy in White **is a very slight DPS loss, as it fills up space where we could have used the Basic or Subtractive Combo instead. However, this is often not possible when fights have more movement than those spells and our regular fast casts can cover. **Do not sacrifice GCD uptime trying to minimize usage of Holy in White. \*\*This is something that should only be considered for extremely low movement fights.

**Outside of movement, the most important aspect of Holy in White usage is adjusting GCD timelines to get the ideal entrance into buff windows.** Care should be taken not to overfocus on generic potency per second averages, and instead to examine specific sequence setups in optimized scenarios. 

We should aim to stretch our movement resources by trying to abuse **Smudge** as often as possible. If it will cause mechanical execution issues, do not use **Smudge** in an unsafe or unnecessary way. Because **Smudge** has such a low cooldown and has a movement speed buff attached to it, we have much greater mobility than our instant cast number would suggest. 

**Downtime** 

We want to aim to swiftcast **Rainbow Drip** on the last hit before phase transitions, or when the boss is about to die. The long recast time and long cast time are mitigated in these circumstances, making it a hefty gain over most GCDs. 

We also want to aim to use **Motifs** during downtime if possible. As the **Motifs** have no potency, preparing them will allow us to use **Muses** that can deal damage when we return to combat. For this reason, Pictomancer is very strong in fights with frequent downtime, such as Dragonsong’s Reprise (Ultimate).

**Defensive Utility**

This is a short overview on how Pictomancer’s unique defensive utilities work. 

Pictomancer has two shield abilities that share a cooldown: **Tempera Coat** and **Tempera Grassa**.

**Tempera Coat** has a base cooldown of 120 seconds and grants a shield equal to 20% of your maximum HP. If this shield is broken, the cooldown is reduced by 60 seconds, effectively becoming a 60 second cooldown. 

**Tempera Grassa** will “spread” your shield, replacing your single target shield and granting the entire party a shield equal to 10% of their maximum HP. If this version of the shield is broken, its cooldown will be reduced by 30 seconds, effectively becoming a 90 second cooldown. 

**Opener**

An opener that we recommend is the “9 Spell Single Muse” opener which aims to get 9 GCDs, **Winged Muse**, and **Mog of the Ages** in the buff window. While the timing on this opener is very tight, being the opener of a fight, it should be easy to replicate in terms of execution. The Motifs are all prepared for the Buff Window, while the rest of the opener is based on the Subtractive Combo and Palette spells.

**Buff Windows**

In both its effects and setup, Pictomancer’s buff window is more complex than most jobs. Let’s break it down, shall we?

<p id="gdcalert62" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image62.png).

  Comparison courtesy of Piyo. That’s a text wall right there…

**Starry Muse** will grant us the following effects: 

* Grants the ability to use **Star Prism**. **Star Prism** is a massive 1300 potency spell and should be placed during the strongest part of the buff window. Uniquely, this spell is also affected by **Hyperphantasia.** **Star Prism**  has a normal 2.5s recast time. This means that, under **Hyperphantasia**, we almost always get a below 2s recast time. This is the chief reason why we can do **nine spells** in buff windows on low Spell Speed builds. 
* Grants a free use of **Subtractive Palette** through the **Subtractive Spectrum** buff. It should be noted that this free use of **Subtractive Palette** is independent of the **Palette Gauge**, so you can be at 100 gauge and use **Starry Muse** without overcapping. 
* Grants **Inspiration** while **Hyperphantasia** stacks are still available. **Inspiration** and **Hyperphantasia** are more or less the same thing and you can consider “affected by **Hyperphantasia**” to be the same thing as “affected by **Inspiration**”. **Hyperphantasia** is just a middleman buff to limit the amount of spells affected by the **Inspiration** speed buff. \
  As we only get five spells that are affected by **Hyperphantasia**, we want to try using spells linked to **Subtractive Palette** with long casts, like **Thunder in Magenta** or **Comet in Black** to consume the **Hyperphantasia** buff. We also want to specifically use **Star Prism** to consume **Hyperphantasia** as well, to fit the maximum number of spells possible in the 20s buff window.  It is important to note that you have to stay within the bounds of the buff area to gain this effect, similar to Black Mage’s **Ley Lines**. It is however significantly larger than **Ley Lines**. 
* When Stacks of **Hyperphantasia** run out, the **Inspiration** speed buff will fade. The buff **Rainbow Bright** will also be granted, making **Rainbow Drip** instant cast with a recast time that is slightly shorter than 2.5s. 

Let's talk a bit about buff window setup. This will be the short version. A longer version will be eventually written up in an Advanced guide.

Because **Aetherhues** makes our combos flexible, we should aim to set up buff windows to cut out weaker Subtractive Combo spells. Primarily, this is because we can only fit 8-9 spells in the buff window. With a large list of spells that take high priority, we only have 2-3 flexible spells left to use. We want these flexible spells to be **Thunder in Magenta** and **Comet in Black,** if possible**.** 

After accounting for movement during fights, if a spare **Holy in White** is available, it should be used to fix GCDs such that part of an Aetherhues combo is performed just before the buff window. This way, **Stone in Yellow** or **Thunder in Magenta** are available to use as the first Subtractive Combo spells in the buff window, cutting out **Blizzard in Cyan** as it is a weaker spell. 

Care should be taken to **late weave Starry Muse**. This is because our buff windows can be very tight, so an early weave **Starry Muse** will lose the last GCD under its buff. 

Let’s now go over a few buff window examples. **As a note, the setup sequence isn’t strict. For example, Subtractive Palette doesn’t have to be used exactly in the manner shown. GCDs can also be swapped around in the buff window itself as long as the rules of the job are obeyed. As a reminder, a list of those rules have been described in the “General Gameplay Flow” section.** 

**9 Spell Single Muse**

<p id="gdcalert63" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image63.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert64">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image63.png "image_tooltip")

**Pros:**

* Highest possible potency in buffs (theorycrafted at the time of writing).

**Cons:**

* Extremely tight in timing, requires precise execution with low spell speed builds. 
* Needs a moderate amount of spell speed to execute reasonably. Can be made easier with increasing spell speed. 

**8 Spell Single Muse**

<p id="gdcalert64" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image64.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert65">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image64.png "image_tooltip")

**Pros:**

* Has easy execution in terms of timing and setup.

**Cons:**

* Has poor potency under buffs compared to other setups. 

**8 Spell Triple Muse**

<p id="gdcalert65" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image65.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert66">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image65.png "image_tooltip")

**Pros:**

* Higher potency than 8 Spell Single Muse. 
* Slightly looser in timing than 9 Spell Single Muse. 

**Cons:**

* Lower potency than 9 Spell Single Muse.
* Still tight in terms of execution. 

**Pictomancer AoE**

Pictomancer’s AoE actions work a bit differently from most jobs. Most payoff spells and abilities, such as **Comet in Black** and **Living Muses**, naturally cleave. Whereas the Basic and Subtractive Combo spells generally have lower potency and need 5-6 targets to exceed the single-target version of the spells. This is not consistent with other jobs which generally exceed single target potencies at 3 targets.  **As a reminder, it is important to note that this information is from pre-release, and may not be the final version in the live game.** 

**In general, Pictomancer AoE actions take this priority:**

**Strongest :D**

**Star Prism**: 

<p id="gdcalert66" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image66.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert67">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image66.jpg "image_tooltip")

Star Prism is our strongest AoE spell. In dungeons, this should generally be the first AoE spell used after all enemies have been gathered in one place.

**Hammer Combo**:

![alt_text](images/image69.jpg "image_tooltip")

Taking guaranteed critical direct hits into account, Hammer Combo spells have some of our strongest potencies. Additionally, **Striking Muse** has a short cooldown. It is for these two reasons that Hammer spells are high in priority. 

**Living Muses** and **Portraits**: 

<p id="gdcalert70" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image70.jpg).

![alt_text](images/image75.jpg "image_tooltip")

Between pulls or during downtime, a **Creature Motif** should be cast and banked for the next pack of enemies. Remember that **ALL Motifs** are instant cast outside of combat, so it will be easy to keep up with the party in dungeons.We want to use **Living Muses** and **Portraits** while all enemies are still alive to maximize value. After using the “free” **Living Muse** gained from casting **Creature Motifs** between pulls, it is often worth it to hardcast a second **Creature Motif** to use its associated **Living Muse**, or **Portrait** while all or most enemies are still alive. This is because the potency on **Living Muses** and **Portraits** is so high, they will outweigh two casts of most other spells (such as **Holy in White**, Subtractive Combo, and Basic Combo spells). \
**Remember that Comet in Black generally takes priority over hardcast Creature Motif unless a Portrait will also be gained in addition to Living Muse.**

**Comet in Black**: 

<p id="gdcalert76" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image76.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert77">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image76.jpg "image_tooltip")

While the AoE versions of the Subtractive Combo may not be very strong, **Comet In Black** is an outlier. It naturally cleaves, and thus, is our third strongest type of AoE spell. It is often worth using **Subtractive Palette** during AoE scenarios, solely to use **Comet in Black**. 

**Holy in White**: 

<p id="gdcalert77" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image77.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert78">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image77.jpg "image_tooltip")

Because **Holy in White** naturally cleaves, even though it is used mostly for movement in single target scenarios, it becomes one of the stronger AoE spells available to Pictomancer.

**Hardcast Rainbow Drip**: 

<p id="gdcalert78" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image78.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert79">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image78.jpg "image_tooltip")

Because Pictomancer combos generally have weak potency, and because **Rainbow Drip** grants one of our better AoE spells: **Holy in White**, it is often better to use **Hardcast Rainbow Drip** instead of a Basic or Subtractive Combo. However, remember that **Rainbow Drip** cannot generate **Palette Gauge**. Sometimes, it may be better to give up some potency on a previous pull to generate **Palette Gauge** in order to use **Subtractive Palette** (and therefore a **Comet in Black**) on a larger number of enemies in the next pull. 

**Subtractive Palette AoE** **Combo**:

![alt_text](images/image81.jpg "image_tooltip")

**Blizzard II in Cyan**, **Stone II in Yellow**, and **Thunder II in Magenta** are second lowest in priority. It is at least stronger than the basic combo. 

**Basic AoE Combo**:

Our weakest AoE spells, and thus, last in priority.
