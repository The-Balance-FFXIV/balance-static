# Openers

The following are openers you can follow at the beginning of the fight to set up the rest of your rotation and burst windows. For more details about the opener, as well as the skills used within, please read the [Basic Guide, by Eydis](https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/pictomancer/basic-guide/).

**Please note:** the Creature Muse used before your Mog/Madeen use can be any of Pom/Wing/Claw/Maw, so long as you don't overwrite the Mog/Madeen by using  Wing/Maw before using the saved Mog/Madeen charge.

## 9 Spell Single Muse Opener

ï»¿\*\*Please note that you can do these skills in whatever order you please, so long as you fit all of them into the nine spell window. If a fight requires more movement, adjust your hammer and spell order accordingly.\*\*<br>
