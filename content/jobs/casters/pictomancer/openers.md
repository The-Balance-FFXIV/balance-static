# Openers

The following are openers you can follow at the beginning of the fight to set up the rest of your rotation and burst windows. For more details about the opener, as well as the skills used within, please read the [Basic Guide, by Eydis](https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/pictomancer/basic-guide/).

**Please note:** the Creature Muse used before your Mog/Madeen use can be any of Pom/Wing/Claw/Maw, so long as you don't overwrite the Mog/Madeen by using  Wing/Maw before using the saved Mog/Madeen charge.

## Second GCD Opener

ï»¿\*\*Please note that you can do these skills in whatever order you please, so long as you fit all of them into the nine spell window. If a fight requires more movement, adjust your hammer and spell order accordingly.\*\*<br>

![Pictomancer 2nd GCD Opener](/img/jobs/pct/pictomancer_2nd_gcd_starry_opener.png "Pictomancer 9 Spell Single Muse Opener")

* The standard opener for the majority of encounters and party compositions.
* Offers flexibility to adjust your Starry Muse timings to adjust to a 3rd GCD party buff timeline if necessary.
* Also offers flexibility with the use of Holy in White compared to the 3rd GCD Starry opener if it is needed in a fight timeline.
* This opener may have a slight GCD clip depending on ping due to the triple weave after the prepull Rainbow Drip. This clip in the vast majority of cases will not add up to a loss anywhere.

## Third GCD Opener

![3rd GCD Opener](/img/jobs/pct/pictomancer_3rd_gcd_starry_opener.png "3rd GCD Opener")

* A specialized opener that can be used depending on static buff timings, fight phase/kill-time, or ping.
* Ping-friendly option if your latency causes the 2nd GCD Starry Opener to hard clip your GCD significantly and cause the 2nd GCD to be too delayed
* You are in a static party that has decided on 3rd GCD buff timelines from the start
* You have a timeline where using Holy in White is optimal.

# Burst Windows

The following are examples of burst setups for your two-minute windows. Please note that oGCDs used may vary depending on which portraits are available for each window. 

## H2 + H3 Burst

![H2 H3 Burst](/img/jobs/pct/image_2025-05-03_225335312.png "H2 H3 Burst")

This is an alternative window worth considering due to the 7.2 changes that places H1 before the burst window and replaces the Hammer GCD with a subtractive GCD at the end of the burst window. This is generally our default burst window recommendation as of patch 7.2.

## H3 Burst

![H3 Burst](/img/jobs/pct/1000048079.png "H3 Burst")

This is an alternative that is *significantly* tighter to execute. You *can* do this option without hammers, by replacing H3 with a Holy in White or RGB GCD. **DO NOT** meld spell speed to accomplish this window if you're unable to without -- use the H2 + H3 Burst instead.

## 9 Spell Single Muse Burst

![9 GCD Single Muse Burst](/img/jobs/pct/1000091140.png "9 GCD Single Muse Burst")

* This is the "old" standard burst window. It is now a 2-3% loss to use this instead of the above, but can be helpful when learning new fights if you are more comfortable with it.
* This window requires your Starry Muse to be weaved after a hardcast spell, or weaved late after an instant-cast spell in order to reliably fit all 9 spells under Starry, and is naturally tight to execute.
* Due to buff propagation, you want to enter each Starry window with a hardcast Subtractive spell to reliably fit all of your spells in other party member's buffs as well, assuming their buffs aren't being drifted heavily. If you have an AST in the party, make sure the third GCD is a hardcast Subtractive spell as well, to catch their normal Spear timing.
