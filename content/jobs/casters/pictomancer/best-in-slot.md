      item are not yet supported by Etro.
      This set is a good example of a set that should work out well enough for the content you'll be doing in it. Please keep in mind that this set may change as different spell speeds are tested prior to launch, and that this should be replaced starting around level 85. This is a very small benefit to grind if you don't already have this, so don't spend too much time on it if you don't have it ready already.

      If you don't have the savage gear accessible for the above set, this old pre-savage set is a bit easier to obtain.
