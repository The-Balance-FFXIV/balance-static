    description: Absolute highest simming set, but very tight to get rainbow drip in
      set and plays less nice with RDM/SMN.

    description: Slightly lower damage, but if you intend on swapping between PCT
      and either RDM or SMN (or if you have issues fitting the last RD into
      buffs on 2.5), this is worth consideration, as RDM and SMN don't want 2.5
      GCD.
