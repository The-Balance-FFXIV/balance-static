Pictomancer (PCT) is a high burst class with a unique Motif system that sees you painting on your canvas for strong creature attacks, as well as the ability to roam free with a powerful hammer. Its core gameplay revolves around building resources in the form of Muses and paint stacks, culminating in a fast-paced buff window with shortened recast timers under a star-filled landscape, while providing strong utility for its team. PCT joins the ranks of the Magical Ranged DPS role, sharing gear with Black Mage, Summoner and Red Mage.
