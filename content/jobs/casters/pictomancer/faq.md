  - question: "What is my rotation? "
    answer: "Do your opener, then repeat that in each 2 minute window. Between them,
      Pictomancer is extremely freeform. You use your 1-2-3 combo and palette
      swap as necessary. Don't let your hammer charges or monster motifs
      overcap, and enter each 2 minute burst with Hammer, landscape, and a
      monster. You want to have either fang ready, which gives you Madeen, or
      have Madeen ready with a Pom banked. You should be able to Madeen in
      almost every 2 minute window. "
  - question: Is Holy a DPS loss?
    answer: It depends. If using Holy in White does not cost you a potential
      Subtractive Spell or use, it is a gain to use it over a filler Red ->
      Green -> Blue combo that does not result in an extra Subtractive Palete,
      or the resulting Cyan -> Yellow -> Magenta spells. Holy in White can also
      be used in a more advanced scenario to enable Magenta skips, resulting in
      potentially more Subtractive Paletes, while minimizing extra Red and Green
      spells. However, it does become a small loss if it ends up replacing a
      Subtractive spell. Ultimately, while the gains or losses are hard to
      quantify when freestyling, it is still a decent option if you need
      movement in a pinch, as you would lose more damage by not casting.
  - question: How about in AoE?
    answer: Holy is a DPS gain on two or more targets -- use it as you'd like!
  - question: Do combos break?
    answer: "No, you can execute other actions between hits of your standard Red ->
      Green -> Blue combo, as well as during your three-hit hammer combo. You
      can also use Subtractive Palette *during* your standard combo. If you use
      subtractive after casting Fire In Red, you can then cast Stone in Yellow
      -> Thunder in Magenta -> Blizzard in Cyan. The potency is the same as
      doing 1-2-3, just in a different order. "
  - question: How does Comet in Black work?
    answer: When you activate Subtractive Palette, you gain a buff with an infinite
      duration that allows you to execute ONE Comet. Comet and Holy are mutually
      exclusive, so after Subtractive Palette, you have to execute Comet before
      you are allowed to use Holy. This may change in live, but that seems
      unlikely. If you have no comet when you use subtractive, it will let you
      cast comet as soon as you finish Thunder in Magenta, which gives a white
      paint. The buff doesn't actually "flip" anything, it just lets you cast
      Comet in exchange for a white.
  - question: How do I handle my opener in fights that require a high amount of
      movement during the CYM casts?
    answer: The order of the GCDs in the opener doesn't need to be followed exactly.
      If you need the movement during that window, feel free to move your hammer
      and spell uses around accordingly. All that matters is you fit the skills
      all in the buff window.
