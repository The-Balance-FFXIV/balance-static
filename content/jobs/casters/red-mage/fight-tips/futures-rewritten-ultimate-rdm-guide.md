# Introduction

This raid has some of the more lenient DPS checks in terms of on-content Ultimate fights. However, the difficulty of the DPS checks in the first two phases will vary greatly depending on your composition as they are quite downtime-heavy, so you may find yourself having to shift your damage around these first two phases a fair bit. Additionally, this fight sees a much larger population of double caster compositions than prior Ultimate fights, due to the popularity of Pictomancer in the fight. This guide will account for as many possible scenarios as possible regarding damage compositions and fake melee positions.

The fight consists of five primary phases and an intermission phase, with varying DPS checks and mechanical difficulties. These phases are commonly referred to by numbers, and will be referenced as below:

* Fatebreaker: P1
* Usurper of Frost: P2
* Ice Veil/Crystals of Light: Intermission
* Oracle of Darkness: P3
* Oracle Duo: P4
* Pandora: P5

## Gearing and GCD Speed

This fight doesn't really benefit from any particular GCD speed value, as most phase timings leave you with plenty of time to get your last hit in on the boss regardless of your GCD. The one exception to this is P4, where your final GCD may be a bit tight on slower GCD speeds. However, this singular case isn't really enough to recommend against using a slower GCD speed, and so we recommend you use whatever BiS set is most comfortable for you.

## Addle and Magick Barrier Usage

Generally speaking, each phase has two different patterns of Addle mitigation that you can use, and generally speaking, by picking one of these patterns in phase 1, you will be locked into that pattern for phase 2. Therefore, it is important to know what your group is doing so that you know where it will be most helpful for you to use Addle.

Magick Barrier should typically be used on downtime mechanics in the first two phases, and then it can be used as extra mitigation from P3 onwards, either to fill in gaps or provide additional reinforcement to particularly heavy hits.

## Embolden and Potion Usage

In this fight, Embolden should be used off cooldown until P3. Once you reach P3, the next three uses of raid buffs will typically be delayed. In P3, raid buffs are delayed due to the stun at the end of Ultimate Relativity, and in P4, they are delayed because we want to maximize buffed cleave damage on both bosses. We then hold our raid buffs at the end of P4 to get three uses in P5, as P5 has the tightest DPS check of any phase in the fight.

* P1: Opener \[potion] and post-Fall of Faith
* P2: Mirror, Mirror
* Intermission: Second GCD or ASAP, whichever comes later \[potion]
* P3: Second GCD after Ultimate Relativity
* P4: Right as Oracle of Darkness becomes targetable \[potion off cooldown]
* P5: Reopener, Fulgent Blade 2 cast, after final Akh Morn

## Manafication Usage

Unlike the Ultimate fights in Endwalker, we do not default to using Manafication off cooldown in this fight. The primary reason for this is that a successful Manafication rush in this fight requires your P1 and P4 killtimes to lose only a combined 7 seconds to their enrage times. Even in lower damage compositions, this can be a very large ask, as compositions that have less damage in P1 tend to have far more damage in P4, either due to cleave or resource holding, and while many groups often hold their damage in P1, it is extremely uncommon to see anyone holding damage in P4, which typically results in a kill around 10 seconds before enrage due to the bosses being locked into their attack animations.

However, we don't want to fully align with buffs, as we have the potential to gain a usage due to the holding of buffs in P4 right before a long cutscene. By using Manafication no later than after our 10th GCD in the phase, we are able to press it again just before being stunned at the end of Crystallize Time, which has it come off cooldown just in time for our reopener on Pandora.

Additionally, if your group has high P1 damage, we have the potential to "smuggle" our stacks of Enchanted Swordplay and our Prefulgence proc from the second use of Manafication into P2 by delaying it until after we finish a combo in the second burst window of the phase. This will be discussed in more detail in the P1 section of the guide.

## Vercure Usage

As with other fights in the game, Vercure can be used during downtime in-between phases and during downtime mechanics; Utopian Sky and Diamond Dust are the primary use cases in this fight. Most downtime phases in this fight should be ended with a Dualcast prepared, so that you can open on the boss with an instant cast. Additionally, in any downtime mechanic where you aren't using your sprint and raise recovery is an option, you can prepare a Dualcast to have it ready for any raises.

## AoE for Mana Generation and Holding DPS

If your group wants a slower P1 killtime, you can contribute to this without losing out on mana generation by using Verthunder II and Veraero II to keep generating mana while dealing significantly reduced damage. Additionally, if your P1 killtime is faster than you expected it to be, you can take advantage of the fixed killtimes of P2 and P3 by using these spells to generate mana if your damage is more than enough to take the bosses below 20% before they hit their enrage timers.

# Phase One: Fatebreaker

The suggested opener for this fight starts your first melee combo early in order to fit two uses of Grand Impact into buffs without using Swiftcast, as using Swiftcast makes us unable to get our last GCD before the boss becomes untargetable. The Addle usage in the opener assumes that your mitigation plan has you using Addle on the opening cleaves and stack/spread, and our last melee-range oGCD happens right before having to move away from the boss for spreads.

## Utopian Sky

You can make liberal use of Vercure here to help your healers. Starting a Vercure cast at around the "n" in the Blasting Zone cast bar will snapshot the healing after you take damage, and you can cast a second Vercure immediately afterwards to give yourself some wiggle room for the upcoming mechanic. Similarly, you can start a Vercure cast at around the "a" in the Cyclonic Break cast bar, then immediately cast a second one for safety. Alternatively, during prog, you can hold your Dualcast until after the AoEs resolve to see if someone needs to be revived.

Once the tethers go out, you can prepare a Dualcast as soon as you reach your position before the knockback, and it will last long enough to use after downtime ends. In order to get all of your oGCDs out, it can be helpful to use Swiftcast right after the knockback ends to give yourself two weave windows while keeping a charge of Acceleration.

## Fall of Faith

Assuming you are doing a conga line setup for this mechanic, you may want to hold your sprint for it, so that if you get a tether, you can get into position more quickly to avoid confusing people looking for positions in the conga line. You can use your charge of Acceleration to temporarily align your weaves for Fleche, then use the Grand Impact proc to facilitate whatever movement you need to do between the hits of the mechanic. Use Swiftcast as it comes off cooldown to re-align your Dualcast in time for Contre Sixte coming off cooldown.

## Two-Minute Burst and Towers

If the knockback option is chosen, it will happen around the 7th GCD of your burst. If you plan to do a double melee combo for this burst, you can easily set up a -5 double combo, weaving Embolden and Manafication after the first Redoublement. If your party composition particularly struggles with damage in this phase, you can hold a use of Corps-a-Corps for when the towers resolve so that you can use a third melee combo after towers. Once the boss dies, prepare a Dualcast for the P2 opener.

Conversely, if your party has no issues with the DPS check and is considering holding damage into the next phase, you can "smuggle" your free combo and Prefulgence into P2. Don't start a combo until after you've used Embolden, then execute the entire combo and finishers before using Manafication, then Dualcast once and use Acceleration to get Grand Impact in buffs. After buffs end, keep an eye on your Enchanted Swordplay timer as the boss dies. If the boss dies before the timer hits 10s, prepare a Dualcast going into P2. If the timer hits 10s before the boss dies, you will need to open with a combo to avoid having the buff fall off.

## Mitigation Usage

If your mitigation plan doesn't have you use Addle in the opener, it might ask you to use it for the first Burnished Glory raidwide, after Utopian Sky. However, it can be rough for us to have the bandwidth to get all of our weaves out. If you use Magick Barrier about a second after the tethered players have been suspended in the air, it will cover both the stacks and the following Burnished Glory raidwide. Realistically, this is enough to cover your assigned mitigation for this raidwide, and you should be using this Magick Barrier regardless of your mitigation plan.

If you used Addle in the opener, you should Addle the second Burnished Glory raidwide, and you should try to do it during the castbar so that it also covers the tankbuster. It might not be necessary depending on when your tanks are using their invulns, but it's good practice to do it anyway.

# Phase Two: Usurper of Frost

You have 14 GCDs' worth of uptime on the boss before Diamond Dust. Our default option for this reopener is with a prepared Dualcast, unless you are doing the Swordplay smuggling strategy and don't have enough time to spend the charges after an instant spell. 

When you open with an instant cast from a prepared Dualcast, you have an odd number of GCDs left before downtime. Using Swiftcast or a melee combo will add an odd number of GCDs. Therefore, the combined number of uses of Dualcast, Swiftcast, and melee combos should be even. For example, if you prepare a Dualcast and use one melee combo, you don't want to use Swiftcast, as you have eight additional GCDs left. However, if you prepare a Dualcast and use two melee combos, you do want to use Swiftcast, as you have three additional GCDs left.

You should aim to spend all uses of Acceleration, Corps-a-Corps, and Engagement before the downtime starts. Depending on how fast your P1 kill was, you might not be able to get your last uses out before the boss is untargetable, and if you don't get them out, they will overcap during downtime. This is why we suggested reopening with a double instant after Utopian Sky, to maximize your chance of getting these uses. It's also advisable to not use Grand Impact as your last GCD before downtime, as the delayed damage application can cause it to ghost. Use it before the last GCD.

## Diamond Dust

You can use Vercure to prepare a Dualcast after the knockback, as soon as the ice star AoEs explode. This Dualcast can either be used after the second or third hit of the stacks to assist your healers, since you are the squishiest caster DPS, or it can be held until after the stacks resolve to pick up a dead party member. You can then prepare another Dualcast after you are finished sliding, then use Swiftcast to open with two instant casts.

## Mirror, Mirror

When the boss becomes targetable again, you should weave Fleche and Contre Sixte after your first instant cast. The second weave window is open for Addle if your mitigation plan calls for it.

This mechanic poses a logistical challenge for us on Red Mage in the ranged position, as it happens during a burst window and forces us away from the boss. The ideal melee combo timing for this mechanic is to start a melee combo on the fourth or fifth GCD after the boss becomes targetable. If you had a late P1 killtime, Embolden typically lines up very well with this timing to get a 1e23, 12e3, or 123e double combo. Make sure that you have a charge of Engagement so that you can use Displacement after the second Redoublement to jump towards your mirror. As a general rule of thumb, if your Engagement cooldown timer is lower than your Fleche cooldown timer, you should spend the charge, as Fleche comes off cooldown right around when you need to be moving away from the boss. Otherwise, you can hold the charge without worrying about overcapping.

If you had an extremely late P1 killtime and need to start the combo on the fourth GCD to line up with buffs, you can use Acceleration after the second instant cast, spend the Acceleration buff, use a double melee combo, then immediately cast Grand Impact to avoid having the buff fall off.

If your P1 killtime is fast enough that you won't align with buffs if you start your first combo on the fifth GCD, it's better to take suboptimal buff alignment by starting the combo on the fifth GCD anyway, using Embolden when it comes off cooldown. There is a theoretical range of P1 killtimes around 15 seconds faster than the enrage timer where it becomes possible to hold your first melee combo until after the first mirror, using Corps-a-Corps to initiate your first melee combo, using buffs, and sprinting to the second mirror. However, these faster killtimes are much less common with a Red Mage in the party, so it is difficult to extensively test it.

This is one of two instances in the fight where Red Mage has a significant difference when played in the melee position. Because of the fact that melees stay in range of the boss for the entirety of Mirror, Mirror, you don't need to worry about faster P1 killtimes and can align your double combo with buffs in any scenario.

After your combos are finished, the rest of the movement can be handled with Dualcasts and whatever charges of Acceleration you have remaining. Sprint is helpful, but not necessary.

## Light Rampant

During prog, it can be helpful to use Vercure to heal someone who's being targeted by the puddles, as they take more damage than everyone else in the mechanic, so keeping them topped can help the healers out. However, it's not helpful to use Vercure in this mechanic beyond early prog, as there aren't any possible deaths that you can recover from with a well-timed Verraise.

Once you arrive at either the middle tower or your clock spot, prepare a Dualcast, then spend your charges of Corps-a-Corps and Engagement after spending the Dualcast. Use a melee combo, weaving Fleche and Contre Sixte as well as your remaining charges of Corps-a-Corps and Engagement when they come off cooldown, as there's not enough time to get two uses of either Fleche or Contre Sixte in this short uptime phase.

## Mitigation Usage

If your mitigation plan asks you to Addle the first Burnished Glory in P1, it will likely have you using Addle on Diamond Dust and the Banish into Light Rampant combo. If your mitigation plan asks you to Addle the P1 opener and the second Burnished Glory, it will likely have you using Addle on the Hallowed Ray line stack and the Absolute Zero enrage. Regardless of your plan, you should use Magick Barrier when the Usurper of Frost's knockback animation happens during Diamond Dust, and on the Absolute Zero enrage.

# Intermission

When you come out of being frozen, use Swiftcast instead of preparing a Dualcast, because you want to use a potion as soon as possible. Once your crystal is targetable, spend the Swiftcast on Veraero or Verthunder, then weave either Embolden or Fleche, depending on your party's buff timing, as well as Manafication. Initiate a melee combo, weave whichever of Embolden or Fleche you didn't already use, then weave Contre Sixte after Zwerchhau, and Corps-a-Corps and Engagement after Redoublement. 

If you are in the ranged position, you can move to your Dark Crystal after Redoublement. Depending on your level of confidence, you can press Sprint after your first finisher, run to the other nearby Light Crystal after your first baited cone appears, standing on top of it when you cast Resolution to cleave both, then run back to your Dark Crystal for the second bait. Regardless of what you do, you should weave Acceleration after the first finisher, as well as weaving Vice of Thorns and Prefulgence at any point while buffs are still active. Spend both the Acceleration and Grand Impact, then weave Acceleration again if it's available, or Dualcast if it's not. 

If all of the Light Crystals are destroyed at this point, you can initiate a melee combo on the Ice Veil, making sure to stay at max melee or step away after the Riposte to properly bait your Dark Crystal. If there are still living Light Crystals, you can use Acceleration if it's come off cooldown, or a Dualcast if you already used your second Acceleration. Once your second melee combo is complete, if you did four casts between melee combos, you will have time for two more casts, and you should spend your second Acceleration if it hadn't come off cooldown after using your first one.

If you are in the melee position, you may choose to start your second melee combo on your Light Crystal as well. This results in a bit more damage on your crystal, which can help because as a fake melee, you have a healer helping with your crystal instead of a tank.

# Phase Three: Oracle of Darkness

Prepare a Dualcast after the Junction raidwide in downtime. Unlike other phases, it is advisable to start this phase without using Swiftcast, as this aligns your Dualcast movement windows very nicely with the movements in Ultimate Relativity. As usual, you should aim to get all of your oGCDs on cooldown as soon as possible entering this phase. If you followed this guide's recommendations for Intermission, Contre Sixte will likely not quite be off cooldown in time for the first weave window, and so should be weaved in the second.

## Ultimate Relativity

Despite the fact that you can technically handle all of the movement in Ultimate Relativity with Dualcasts, you will still need to use a melee combo and a charge of Acceleration to keep them from overcapping, and so it's advisable to use them to assist with movement, especially when you need to move out for a fire drop while avoiding a laser baited towards where you need to drop your fire. 

The easiest solution is to start a melee combo after Dualcast where the Ultimate Relativity cast finishes, then check your fire/ice debuff. If you have *anything except* the 20s fire debuff, you can weave Swiftcast after Redoublement, using it to move in after either dropping your rewind or baiting your laser. If you have the 20s fire debuff, you should instead finish the melee combo, Dualcast, then weave Swiftcast as you start moving out to drop your fire, using it to start moving back in after dropping your fire. 

Using Acceleration to handle your second movement is recommended; however, if your P1 killtime was fast enough, using Acceleration here will leave you without an Acceleration to get your last GCD in before the Return stun, which is awkward if you have the 20s fire debuff, as you will likely not be able to stand on the other side of the boss to control your facing direction for Return. If you want to be able to ensure that you have this use of Acceleration for the Return stun, you can compare your Acceleration timer to the cooldown of your Eruption/Eye debuff. If the Acceleration cooldown number is at least 4 seconds lower than the debuff timer, it will come off cooldown in time for you to use it and get your last cast before Return, as it doesn't matter if you clip your GCD to get it.

If the timers don't line up in this way, you only have the option of starting a Dualcast, as we want to have an instant ready for after Return. You can either stand on the side of the boss opposite to your temporary clock spot for the mechanic so that your cast automatically faces you towards the boss, or if you aren't able to get on that side of the boss in time, you can face the correct direction ahead of time and use Vercure to prepare the Dualcast. As mentioned in the introduction, buffs should be held until after Return completes; when you regain control, spend the Dualcast, then initiate a double melee combo, buffing either after Riposte or Zwerchhau depending on your group's buff timing.

## Apocalypse

Once your double combo is complete, you should do three Dualcasts while waiting for Apocalypse, spending Corps-a-Corps and Engagement after the second Dualcast if they are available, or holding them if they become available after the second Dualcast. The timers will be assigned right before you start your third Dualcast; if you are in the fake melee position, be prepared to flex to the other side. After three Dualcasts, starting a melee combo will allow you to disengage from the boss for Spirit Taker after Redoublement. You should weave Swiftcast at any point after Redoublement, spending it to ensure that you're in the exact position for Apocalypse spreads, and sprinting after spending it. Use a Dualcast and a charge of Acceleration to run to the middle for the second water stacks, Dualcast normally to move into position for Darkest Dance knockback, then intentionally clip your GCD to weave Corps-a-Corps after the knockback. Doing this will not lose you a GCD in the phase, and if you start a Dualcast instead of gap closing back in, you risk missing the final water stack.

## Mitigation Usage

Intermission serves as a hard reset for mitigation, so you will once again be faced with two possible mitigation options from here. However, these are typically differentiated by whether your group is running a double caster composition. As a solo caster, you will typically want to use Addle on Ultimate Relativity, use Barrier on either the first UR fire spread or after your instant cast after Return to catch both Shell Crusher and the following Shockwave Pulsar, and then Addle again on the Memory's End enrage. You can also use Barrier on Memory's End if you did the earlier timing. If you are in a double caster composition, you may instead be asked to Addle two of the UR fire spreads or the Shell Crusher and following Shockwave Pulsar, and you can use Magick Barrier on whichever one you didn't Addle.

# Phase Four: Oracle Duo

We recommend intentionally overcapping mana at some point in this phase in order to enter P5 with 100|100. The two most likely candidates for overcapping are the reopener and post-Crystallize Time, and you may end up overcapping in both spots depending on your P1 killtime and whether you attempt to do any Reprise optimization in the first half of the fight.

Buffs will again be held for when the Oracle of Darkness becomes targetable; this happens roughly 10 GCDs into the phase. Probably the best way to approach this reopener is to prepare a Dualcast and Swiftcast in the short downtime before the phase starts, spend both, then stand middle and perform three more Dualcast pairs before starting your first melee combo. This timing has you move out for Akh Rhai right after the third Dualcast, and it allows you to weave Embolden and Manafication after Redoublement to line Embolden up with when the Oracle of Darkness becomes targetable. You don't want to use Manafication any later than the 10th GCD's weave window for reasons that will be discussed later.

## Darklit Dragonsong

If you do this combo timing, you can target the Oracle of Darkness for the first finisher of your first combo, and your potion will come off cooldown after the first Resolution, assuming you used it ASAP in Intermission. Continue with a full triple combo, keeping in mind that if you end up in the north tower, you will need to switch targets back to the Usurper of Frost to do your third melee combo and spend any remaining charges of Corps-a-Corps and Engagement once you're in the tower. Make sure you weave Acceleration during your third combo to avoid overcapping. The Oracle of Darkness will jump towards the farthest player after your third combo finishes, and this can cause her to be out of range to cleave both bosses. For the safest damage, you should do a Dualcast, use your lingering instant on Verthunder/Veraero, and then cast Grand Impact, at which point the bosses will have jumped middle and will be able to be cleaved again.

As per usual, make sure you spend all of your charges of oGCDs before Crystallize Time. The Oracle of Darkness becomes untargetable one second later than the Usurper of Frost, so if you weave Swiftcast after the Crystallize Time cast finishes, you can potentially sneak one last hit onto her before she becomes untargetable.

## Crystallize Time

There are really no places where Vercure healing is helpful for this mechanic, and there are places where you want to sprint, which will cancel a prepared Dualcast. If you are popping the dragon heads, you can prepare a Dualcast once you've reached north or south after popping your dragon head. If you are picking up a puddle, you can prepare a Dualcast once you've arrived in your initial position, keeping in mind that it will get cancelled if you sprint to pick up your puddle.

Due to the fact that buffs are held at the end of this phase to get three uses in P5, we can gain a use of Manafication by using it right before the Return at the end of Crystallize Time. You can then use the combo immediately when the bosses are targetable, spending your oGCDs in any order as long as you use Acceleration in time for Grand Impact and Impact to be your first two GCDs after Resolution, as they will be the last two GCDs you get if the bosses die as early as possible. Regardless of whether the bosses need more damage after these two GCDs, it's advisable to only use one charge of Acceleration and allow it to overcap during the cutscene to allow for more consistent movement options in P5.

## Mitigation Usage

You will typically be tasked with using Addle on either both Akh Morn + Morn Afah combos or on Crystallize Time. Make sure you use Addle on the Usurper of Frost for the Akh Morn Afah combos, or on Oracle of Darkness for Crystallize Time.

If you used Magick Barrier on Memory's End, you won't be able to use it again until the second Akh Morn Afah combo. If you didn't use it on Memory's End, you can also use it on Darklit Dragonsong.

# Phase Five: Pandora

If you enter this phase with capped mana, the movement plan is consistent and easy to follow.

* Acceleration and three melee combos for reopener buffs and Fulgent Blade 1 (exalines)
* Acceleration for Wings Light and Dark 1 (towers)
* One melee combo, Swiftcast, and Acceleration for Polarizing Strikes 1
* Swiftcast and three melee combos for 2m buffs and Fulgent Blades 2, with potion
* Acceleration for Wings Light and Dark 2
* One melee combo, Swiftcast, and Acceleration for Polarizing Strikes 2
* Acceleration and Swiftcast for Fulgent Blade 3, saving two melee combos for the final burst window

Once you regain control after the cutscene, immediately use Acceleration and cast either Verthunder or Veraero, weaving Fleche and Contre Sixte, then start a double melee combo weaving Embolden after the first Riposte, Engagement after the first Zwerchhau, and Manafication and Corps-a-Corps after the first Redoublement. The uses of your damaging oGCDs are flexible here, as the enrage timer of this phase leaves barely not enough time for an additional use of any of them right at the end of the fight, but using Fleche and Contre Sixte earlier allows you more freedom for small drifts throughout the phase.

These two melee combos will cover most of the first set of Fulgent Blade exalines. After completing your second melee combo, cast Grand Impact to avoid losing it, then use a third melee combo to finish your movement towards your Akh Morn stack. After two Dualcasts, you can use Acceleration and move into your starting position for Wings Dark and Light, then start moving to your tower as soon as the cast finishes, with the movement being fully covered by Acceleration.

Preposition in your stack position for the next mechanic. You want to use Swiftcast before your combo here so that it can be used later to align a triple melee combo with a potion at the next buff window. Once you see the cast bar for the first Polarizing Strikes, initiate another Dualcast, then weave Swiftcast after it finishes. Spend the Swiftcast, then do a melee combo, using Acceleration to cover the tail end of the movement to ensure you don't get clipped by the final line.

Swiftcast should be coming off cooldown with around 7 seconds left on your Embolden cooldown; weave and spend it immediately, then initiate a triple melee combo, weaving Embolden and Manafication after the first Redoublement. You have two options for your potion timing here. The first is the more traditional option of weaving it after Verflare/Verholy, which unfortunately means that your first GCD in buffs isn't under potion. The second possible timing is to instead weave the potion after your first Riposte. This is a somewhat unorthodox potion timing for a triple melee combo, but it operates on a similar principle to a 1e23 double combo, and just barely puts less potency into the potion than a more standard pot timing where buffs happen during the second melee combo rather than the first. Whichever potion timing you choose, this is the preferred triple combo timing for this burst window, as there isn't a lot of leeway on your mana totals, so delaying the first combo as much as possible ensures that you get the triple combo, and using the potion earlier ensures that you fully overlap the potion with your buff window.

Movement in the second loop should be handled very similarly to the first loop. The main consideration here is that Acceleration will cap earlier into the loop than it did in the first loop, so if you want to use Acceleration for both Wings Light and Dark and Polarizing Strikes, you will need to hold a Verfire/Verstone proc. If you have one available and you weave Acceleration at the last moment before it overcaps, you can use that proc, get your guaranteed proc from Acceleration and spend the Dualcast, then use the newly-generated proc to set up another Dualcast. The second Dualcast will be perfectly timed such that you need to move to your tower as soon as the second cast happens, and then you can use your leftover Grand Impact to finalize your position in the tower.

Fulgent Blade 3 is somewhat sketchy, as you want to hold your two melee combos for the final burst. However, the movement can easily be handled with a single Acceleration and a single Swiftcast. As soon as the first hit of the first set of lines goes off, weave Acceleration in your next weave window, then spend the Acceleration buff to move into the second hit. Use the newly-generated Verstone/Verfire proc to set up a Dualcast, moving into the second hit of the second set of lines after that Dualcast, then cast Grand Impact and weave Swiftcast to finish dodging the third set of lines. 

Clip of the above: <https://www.twitch.tv/cyclopsdragon/clip/MistyIntelligentFlyCclamChamp-8bMsQILC1Kam337T>

This last Swiftcast GCD will be the last GCD before you initiate your final double melee combo, weaving Embolden and Manafication after Redoublement. Once these combos are complete, you can spam Enchanted Reprise with your remaining mana for a last bit of damage before enrage. Congratulations on your clear!

## Mitigation Usage

As a solo caster, you will typically be tasked with Addling all three Akh Morns, and as a fake melee caster, you will typically either be tasked with Addling the Fulgent Blade casts or the Polarizing Strikes. In either position, you should use Barrier on the first Akh Morn and the second Polarizing Strikes.
