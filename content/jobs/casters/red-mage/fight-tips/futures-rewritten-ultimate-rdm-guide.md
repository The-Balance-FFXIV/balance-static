# Introduction

This raid has some of the more lenient DPS checks in terms of on-content Ultimate fights. However, the difficulty of the DPS checks in the first two phases will vary greatly depending on your composition as they are quite downtime-heavy, so you may find yourself having to shift your damage around these first two phases a fair bit. Additionally, this fight sees a much larger population of double caster compositions than prior Ultimate fights, due to the popularity of Pictomancer in the fight. This guide will account for as many possible scenarios as possible regarding damage compositions and fake melee positions.

The fight is comprised of five primary phases and an intermission phase, with varying DPS checks and mechanical difficulties. These phases are commonly referred to by numbers, and will be referenced as below:

* Fatebreaker: P1
* Usurper of Frost: P2
* Ice Veil/Crystals of Light: Intermission
* Oracle of Darkness: P3
* Oracle Duo: P4
* Pandora: P5

## Gearing and GCD Speed

This fight doesn't really benefit from any particular GCD speed value, as most phase timings leave you with plenty of time to get your last hit in on the boss regardless of your GCD. The one exception to this is P4, where your final GCD may be a bit tight on slower GCD speeds. However, this singular case isn't really enough to recommend against using a slower GCD speed, and so we recommend you use whatever BiS set is most comfortable for you.

## Addle and Magick Barrier Usage

Generally speaking, each phase has two different patterns of Addle mitigation that you can use, and generally speaking, by picking one of these patterns in phase 1 or 3, you will be locked into that pattern for phase 2 and 4, respectively. Therefore, it is important to know what your group is doing so that you know where it will be most helpful for you to use Addle.

Magick Barrier should typically be used on downtime mechanics in the first two phases, and then it can be used as extra mitigation from P3 onwards, either to fill in gaps or provide additional reinforcement to particularly heavy hits.

## Embolden and Potion Usage

In this fight, Embolden should be used off cooldown until P3. Once you reach P3, the next three uses of raid buffs will typically be delayed. In P3, raid buffs are delayed due to the stun at the end of Ultimate Relativity, and in P4, they are delayed because we want to maximize buffed cleave damage on both bosses. We then hold our raid buffs at the end of P4 to get three uses in P5, as P5 has the tightest DPS check of any phase in the fight.

* P1: Opener \[potion] and post-Fall of Faith
* P2: Mirror, Mirror
* Intermission: Second GCD or ASAP, whichever comes later \[potion]
* P3: Second GCD after Ultimate Relativity
* P4: Right as Oracle of Darkness becomes targetable \[potion off cooldown]
* P5: Reopener, Fulgent Blade 2 cast, after final Akh Morn

## Manafication Usage

Unlike the Ultimate fights in Endwalker, we do not default to using Manafication off cooldown in this fight. The primary reason for this is that a successful Manafication rush in this fight requires your P1 and P4 killtimes to lose only a combined 7 seconds to their enrage times. Even in lower damage compositions, this can be a very large ask, as compositions that have less damage in P1 tend to have far more damage in P4, either due to cleave or resource holding, and while many groups often hold their damage in P1, it is extremely uncommon to see anyone holding damage in P4, which typically results in a kill around 10 seconds before enrage due to the bosses being locked into their attack animations.

However, we don't want to fully align with buffs, as we have the potential to gain a usage due to the holding of buffs in P4 right before a long cutscene. By using Manafication no later than after our 10th GCD in the phase, we are able to press it again just before being stunned at the end of Crystallize Time, which has it come off cooldown just in time for our reopener on Pandora.

Additionally, if your group has high P1 damage, we have the potential to "smuggle" our stacks of Enchanted Swordplay and our Prefulgence proc from the second use of Manafication into P2 by delaying it until after we finish a combo in the second burst window of the phase. This will be discussed in more detail in the P1 section of the guide.

## Vercure Usage

As with other fights in the game, Vercure can be used during downtime in-between phases and during downtime mechanics; Utopian Sky and Diamond Dust are the primary use cases in this fight. Most downtime phases in this fight should be ended with a Dualcast prepared, so that you can open on the boss with an instant cast. Additionally, in any downtime mechanic where you aren't using your sprint and raise recovery is an option, you can prepare a Dualcast to have it ready for any raises.

## AoE for Mana Generation and Holding DPS

If your group wants a slower P1 killtime, you can contribute to this without losing out on mana generation by using Verthunder II and Veraero II to keep generating mana while dealing significantly reduced damage. Additionally, if your P1 killtime is faster than you expected it to be, you can take advantage of the fixed killtimes of P2 and P3 by using these spells to generate mana if your damage is more than enough to take the bosses below 20% before they hit their enrage timers.
