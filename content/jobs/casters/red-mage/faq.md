  - question: How should I use Manafication?
    answer: You should be using Manafication on cooldown, or as close to on cooldown
      as possible. If using it when it comes off cooldown will cause you to
      overcap your Black or White Mana, you can start a combo first and use it
      after your three melee hits, as the melee hits and finishers are
      considered two separate combos by the game. This allows you to use the
      finishers and the three melee hits from a second combo under the
      Manafication buff. If fight phasing or predictable killtimes allow you to
      delay Manafication for Embolden or buffed double combos under potion, you
      should aim to do this. If these do not apply, however, you should continue
      to use Manafication on cooldown, as losing a use of Manafication will
      offset any gain you received by delaying it and will be an overall loss.
  - question: Should I use two melee combos under my Embolden?
    answer: As Embolden is 20 seconds long, and a full melee combo now takes around
      12.7 seconds, it is not possible to fit two full combos under one
      Embolden. Your priority should be to always use one melee combo under
      Embolden. If you use Embolden after Enchanted Redoublement, it is possible
      to fit three finishers as well as a full second combo under Embolden. If
      you are able to time this with Embolden, it is good practice to do --
      however, there may be times where your first combo is better used
      elsewhere, such as if it is needed for movement.
  - question: How should I use Swiftcast and Acceleration?
    answer: >-
      When using Swiftcast it should be used to instantly cast Veraero or
      Verthunder. The priority for Swiftcast and Acceleration usage is as
      follows


      * Holding it for mechanics, such as periods of extended movement where Dualcasting would get you killed. 

      * For GCD alignment reasons, such as shifting your Dualcast windows to avoid oGCD drift or to line up better with mechanics.

      * Purely for damage, fixing mana, or fishing for procs. This is generally the smallest potency gain. It is only recommended after you have a deeper understanding of the fight and know which specific times you can afford to do this.
  - question: What does oGCD alignment mean?
    answer: >-
      Off-Global Cooldown alignment refers to keeping our oGCDs (primarily
      Fleche, Contre Sixte, Embolden, and Manafication) aligned with our
      Dualcast windows. Our oGCD cooldowns are multiples of five and the Global
      Cooldown is 2.5 seconds, so our oGCDs naturally align with our
      instant-cast GCDs we gain from Dualcast. 


      Because of the uneven number of finishers in our melee combo at level 90, every melee combo will cause these windows to flip, causing oGCD drift. Swiftcast and Acceleration will also cause our Dualcast and our hardcast windows to flip. This means that every time we do a melee combo, one use of Acceleration or Swiftcast will "re-align" our oGCDs with our Dualcast windows.
  - question: Should I be using Engagement instead of Displacement?
    answer: With the potency changes in Endwalker, Engagement and Displacement are
      now the same potency. Therefore, in the majority of situations, it is now
      strictly better to use Engagement instead of Displacement. Displacement
      may still have niche uses, such as for movement when Dualcasting will not
      be fast enough for what is needed, but will generally not be used aside
      from this.
  - question: Should I use Enchanted Reprise?
    answer: With a cost of 5|5 mana, Enchanted Reprise drains a large portion of our
      Black and White mana and its recast time has been increased to 2.5
      seconds. This means that Enchanted Reprise's only uses will be for
      movement when all other tools are depleted, and to get one last hit on a
      boss if there is not enough time for a full Dualcast before it dies.
  - question: How should I use Magick Barrier?
    answer: >-
      Efficient use of Magick Barrier will be fight dependent as well as group
      dependent. If you are playing with a static, it is best to ask your
      healers where Magick Barrier would be best used, similar to Addle. If you
      are playing in a setting with random players, you should use Magick
      Barrier to mitigate raidwides and other magical damage according to your
      own judgment. Keep in mind this ability also buffs healing by 5% as well
      as giving mitigation, which is especially useful in large dungeon pulls.


      Please note that unlike Addle, Magick Barrier is a party buff and not a boss debuff. This allows it to mitigate damage from untargetable actors that Addle cannot cover.
