  - question: How do I use Acceleration in Dawntrail?
    answer: "Acceleration is now primarily a tool used for damage and movement, as
      it grants two instant-casts due to how Grand Impact works. The general
      principle is to always use one charge for damage, and to save the second
      for movement or emergency weaving (i.e. you have important oGCDs to weave
      but you cannot fix your oGCD alignment with Swiftcast or a melee combo).
      Grand Impact can also be used for buffs, but this is a secondary
      consideration, as all of our melee combo finishers still do more
      damage.\r\n"
  - question: How should I use Manafication?
    answer: In unknown killtimes, it is often better to use Manafication as close to
      on cooldown as possible then using it to execute a melee combo. You can
      also align it with Embolden if killtimes allow. But generally, maximizing
      our uses of Manafication is more important, as it grants both an extra
      combo and an extra Prefulgence.
  - question: Should I use two melee combos under my Embolden?
    answer: As a baseline, we are always able to use one melee combo under Embolden.
      That said, a combo is around 12.7 seconds, so we can't fit a full double
      combo under 20 second buffs. Nonetheless, it is good to do double combos
      under buffs (and a triple under potion), but not always feasible depending
      on killtimes, Manafication use, or whether you need combos for movement.
      If doing a double combo, start it 1 or 5 seconds before raid buffs come
      off cooldown.
  - question: What is Enchanted Reprise for?
    answer: Emergency movement, last hitting the boss at the end of a fight, or
      niche optimization for minor damage gains. However, overuse can misalign
      or make us lose a melee combo due to the mana cost. Read the guide for
      more details.
  - answer: Because of the uneven number of finishers in our melee combo at level
      100, every melee combo will cause these windows to flip. Swiftcast will
      also do the same thing. This means that every time we do a melee combo,
      one use of Swiftcast will "re-align" our oGCDs with our Dualcast windows.
      [A video demonstrating this concept can be found here from
      Endwalker](https://bit.ly/3z6Mv7O). Keeping every single oGCD aligned is
      impractical, so the priority oGCDs we want zero drift for are Fleche,
      Contre Sixte, and Embolden (sometimes Manafication but it's more flexible)
      unless planned.
    question: What does oGCD alignment mean?
  - question: Should I be using Engagement instead of Displacement?
    answer: "They have the same potency, so in the majority of situations, it is
      strictly better to use Engagement instead of Displacement. Displacement
      may still have niche uses for convenient movement, but is never
      required.\r\n"
