  - question: When do I use Hypercharge?
    answer: >-
      You can use Hypercharge freely when above 50 heat as long as four
      conditions are met:


      1. Drill, Air Anchor and Chainsaw have more than eight to ten seconds left on cooldown.

      2. You have 0-1 Gauss Round and Ricochet charges stored.

      3. You are using Wildfire or will have enough heat for it later when you need it.
  - question: Do I use Heat Blast during Hypercharge? How many should it fit?
    answer: You want to use either five Heat Blasts or Auto Crossbows in every
      Hypercharge.
  - question: Should I double weave between Heat Blasts?
    answer: No. 1.5s GCD allows a single weave only.
  - question: How do I use Wildfire? How many GCDs should it fit?
    answer: Pair it with Hypercharge to get six GCDs into it. Wildfire can be used
      one GCD before or after Hypercharge but double weaving (Hypercharge→
      Wildfire) is the most ping friendly. It should fit five Heat Blast/Auto
      Crossbow + one GCD when double weaved or used one GCD before Hypercharge,
      OR four Heat Blast/Auto Crossbow + two GCDs if used after the first GCD in
      Hypercharge.
  - question: When does Wildfire snapshot buffs?
    answer: On application, like DoTs.
  - question: When do I use Barrel Stabilizer?
    answer: Barrel Stabilizer should be used on cooldown. It will come up during the
      Hypercharge prior to Wildfire.
  - question: When do I use Reassemble?
    answer: Pair it with Drill, Air Anchor or Chainsaw. Chainsaw works best for raid
      buff alignment. For AoE use it on Chainsaw. Scattergun or Auto Crossbow
      against 3+ targets can be used if you're unable to use it on Chainsaw. It
      doesn't affect the DoT portion of Bioblaster.
  - question: When do I summon Queen?
    answer: During raid buff windows. Every job now bursts in 60s/120s windows, and
      Queen should be summoned prior to them.
  - question: Does Queen add damage to Wildfire?
    answer: No.
  - question: How do buffs affect Queen?
    answer: It mirrors the buffs on yourself in real time. There are no snapshots,
      each attack is checked individually. Dragon Sight doesn't affect Queen.
  - question: Should I detonate Wildfire or use Pile Bunker early?
    answer: No. You would only ever do it if the fight or uptime window is ending
      before they would go off naturally.
  - question: Should I use Flamethrower?
    answer: Yes, for AoE, except if the fight is about to end and you have to choose
      between Flamethrower and Hypercharge, then Hypercharge wins out.
  - question: How do Dismantle and Tactician interact?
    answer: Both Dismantle and Tactician work independently of each other, meaning
      they can be stacked. They function slightly differently. Dismantle
      requires a target, while Tactician does not, but both cover both physical
      and magical damage. As a generalized statement, try to stagger usage of
      these mitigative actions, but if you're unsure of where they're needed,
      ask your healers where they would like them.
  - question: What is the AoE priority?
    answer: |-
      1. Bioblaster 2+ targets
      2. Auto Crossbow 3+ targets
      3. Flamethrower 3+ targets
      4. Scattergun 3+ targets
  - question: How much ping do I need to play this class?
    answer: The golden standard is hitting five Heat Blasts in Hypercharge and one
      extra GCD for Wildfire for a total of six in Wildfire while weaving a
      Gauss Round or Ricochet between every attack for raid buff gains. If you
      can hit the 5 + 1 GCDs while weaving only two times, you can avoid
      overcapping which is passable, but not optimal. If you can't weave at all
      or if you miss GCDs in Hypercharge or Wildfire, then your performance will
      be suboptimal.

# Frequently Asked Questions

> *When do I use Hypercharge?*

You can use Hypercharge freely when above 50 heat as long as four conditions are met:

1. Drill and Air Anchor have more than eight to ten seconds left on cooldown
2. You will not break your combo. (It will break if you try to carry it over HC + Drill + Anchor.)
3. You have 0-1 Gauss Round and Ricochet charges stored.
4. You are using Wildfire or will have enough heat for it later when you need it.

> *Do I use Heat Blast during Hypercharge? How many should it fit?*

You want to use either five Heat Blasts or Auto Crossbows in every Hypercharge.

> *Should I double weave between Heat Blasts?*

No. 1.5s GCD allows a single weave only.

> *How do I use Wildfire? How many gcds should it fit?*

Pair it with Hypercharge to get six GCDs into it. Wildfire can be used one GCD before or after Hypercharge but double weaving (Wildfire→Hypercharge) is the most ping friendly. It should fit five Heat Blast/Auto Crossbow + one GCD when double weaved or used one GCD before Hypercharge, OR four Heat Blast/Auto Crossbow + two GCDs if used after the first GCD in Hypercharge.

> *When does Wildfire snapshot buffs?*

On application, like DoTs.

> *When do I use Barrel Stabilizer?*

Before Wildfire to guarantee heat for Hypercharge, or after it to avoid overcapping.\
Generally it is best to avoid overcapping and it lines up one to two GCDs after Wildfire explodes.

> *When do I use Reassemble?*
> Pair it with Drill or Air Anchor. Drill works best for cooldown alignment. For AoE use it on Spread Shot or Auto Crossbow against 4+ targets since it doesn't affect the DoT portion of Bioblaster.
>
> *When do I summon Queen?*

During raid buff windows. The easiest way to keep track of them is to pair Queen with Reassembled Drill to hit a buff window every 60s. The timing changes a little bit depending on how much gauge you have:

* 50-60 battery → Summon one GCD after Drill.
* 70-80 battery → Summon after Drill.
* 90-100 battery → Summon before Drill.

> *Does Queen add damage to Wildfire?*

No.

> *How do buffs affect Queen?*

It mirrors the buffs on yourself in real time. There are no snapshots, each attack is checked individually. Dragon Sight doesn't affect Queen.

> *Should I detonate Wildfire or use Pile Bunker early?*

No. You would only ever do it if the fight or uptime window is ending before they would go off naturally.

> *Should I use Flamethrower?*

Yes for AoE, except if the fight is about to end and you have to choose between Flamethrower and Hypercharge, then Hypercharge wins out.

> *What is the AoE priority?*

1. Bioblaster 2+ targets
2. Auto Crossbow 3+ targets
3. Flamethrower 3+ targets
4. Spread Shot 3+ targets (2+ targets below lvl80)
