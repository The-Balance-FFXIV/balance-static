    description: The difference between this MCH and DNC set is changing x3 DH melds
      to DET (one DH meld changed to DET on each of the gloves, legs, and
      bracelet) - this would make the set compatible with NIN/VPR bis
      accessories. The DNC set is ~5dps lower than the MCH set, but with the
      added benefit of having the set completely compatible with both DNC and
      the scouting jobs.
