      This set, using the Shadowbringers relic weapon, provides a 3.54% gain
      over the 605 Savage weapon. It's up to you to make the distinction on
      whether or not this is worth the effort. The relic weapon is not required
      to clear.


      Due to iLvL syncing, you can achieve the same result with different pieces using the same stat distribution as long as they are above ilvl 470 for UCoB.
