# Openers

<br>
With the addition of the extra tools, and despite the fact that we want to optimize as best as we can into buffs, it is still ideal to start off with a prepull Reassemble. It shaves off quite a bit of time to get the cooldown rolling and could possibly net us an extra usage depending on the fight layout in Dawntrail. Depending on the fight, we can transpose Drill and Air Anchor in the opener if we can gain an extra Drill for it. 
<br>
<br>
For now, Air Anchor remains the priority due to the huge value of 20 battery compared to the relatively small direct potency gain of using a tool over a combo GCD. The order of the oGCDs isn’t super important - we want to place the 2nd Reassemble in buffs, so it can be used on Excavator (second Chainsaw), or the following Drill, as long as it catches buffs. We want Wildfire to be used as early as possible within the buff window, so we weave it before Full Metal Field (second Barrel Stabilizer). We also aim to fit as many Double Check/Checkmate into buffs as possible. While we would much prefer a 2 minute pot if possible, some fights do not allow for this. If we have to use an opener pot, we want to use it two seconds before pulling the boss.

<br>

Here is an alternate version with the added benefit of following the exact setup for our Even Burst Windows. Pushing our 2nd Drill for after our Hypercharge window to emulate every subsequent 2-Minute burst, since we usually will not go into it with 2/2 Drills outside of specific cases. Using Reassemble on Excavator to ensure its in buffs, but you can place it on the 2nd or 3rd Drill. Since we are using Drill immediately after the 5th Blazing Shot, this eliminates the risk of overcapping at all, even if starting the opener with Drill first.

These are our standard openers for Machinist. For more information on what to do after the opener please refer to the [Basic Guide.](https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/machinist/basic-guide/)
