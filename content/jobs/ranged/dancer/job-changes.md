  - patch: "6.2"
    description: >-
      Dancer has not been changed directly in this patch. However, it is
      affected by the changed interactions between guaranteed Crit or Direct Hit
      abilities and Crit or Direct Hit rate buffs.\

      For one, there is now no longer a consideration to avoid Crit or DH buffs with Starfall Dance, since the Ability will now receive full benefit from these buffs.\

      Additionally, the Dance Partner priority list will change, since a major factor in Dance Partner choice was the benefit from Devilment.
