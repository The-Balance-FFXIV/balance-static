      The 2.49 set is the one that sims the highest under most circumstances so therefore it is the recommended set. If you desire a different GCD, the tiered gearsets for 2.50, 2.48, and 2.47 are provided in link: <https://bit.ly/DNC-Gearsets>

# Gearing Up Guide

[Guide to gearing DNC (5.58)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FPD-xboF_kWqynF9zXJdijOyYJkVjHjMhBbRg11apd4/edit?usp=sharing) - includes starting gear and tomestone buy order

Best starting gearset before accessing any weekly savage gear pieces or spending Tomestones of Revelation: view this [Starting Gearset on Etro](https://etro.gg/gearset/702816d1-c9ef-4ee1-836f-6e9a751b9673).

## Best-in-slot for The Epic of Alexander (TEA)

* Uses the 475 Helm, Chest, Legs, Earrings, and Ring from The Heroes' Gauntlet as well as 470 Tomestones of Phantasmagoria pieces and 470 Eden's Gate Savage pieces.  
* Uses Smoked Chicken + Grade 4 Tincture of Dexterity  
* [BiS with Relic Weapon (i535)](https://etro.gg/gearset/22bf8499-0469-44a2-9174-be8f3174a488)- (max DPS set)

## Catch-all Gearset for other iLvl synced content (UCoB / UWU / Unreal Trials)

[Catch-All Gearset](https://etro.gg/gearset/8e76dbd9-6828-45d1-ae6b-2d2051e2b09f) \
Use Smoked Chicken + Grade 4 Tincture of Dexterity

Not max DPS, but close enough for a catch-all gearset that uses most of current 5.4 BiS gear for synced encounters. Swaps out non-Crit gear pieces for pieces that have Crit. (When last checked, difference between this set and theoretical BiS is ~0.15% DPS difference)

# What to do with ilvl 535 DNC Relic

It’s BiS for current savage content and for old iLvl synced content.

## For current level 80 content:

If you are missing other items for BiS, a good starting point is maxing Crit and DH and putting the rest in DET. You can min/max your relic for your needs by plugging your gear into <https://etro.gg/> and watching for wasted secondary stats.\
To minimize wasted stats, reallocate secondary stats from Crit that go above current stat tier into DET and then adjust DET/DH distribution until total wasted secondary stats is less than 6.\
Keep in mind you'll have to do this every time you get a gear upgrade. Staying with max Crit / max DH / rest DET while gearing up is fine too.

For 5.55 BiS: (see gearset in BiS section)\
DH = 358, Crit = 523, DET = 301, SkS = 0

For TEA: (see gearset in TEA section)\
DH = 346, Crit = 452, DET = 384, SkS = 0

For UCoB:\
DH = 280, Crit = 342, DET = 280, SkS = 280 *Caps all 4 stats so the last 62 points don’t matter. 

For UWU:\
DH = 318, Crit = 318, DET = 318, SkS = 228 *Caps on DH / Crit / DET and rest in SkS

# iLvl 515 DNC Relic

## For current level 80 content:

Staying with max Crit / max DH / rest DET while gearing up is fine.

For TEA: (see gearset in TEA section)\
DH = 407, Crit = 452, DET = 308, SkS = 0 

For UCoB:\
DH = 280, Crit = 327, DET = 280, SkS = 280 *Caps on all 4 stats so last 47 points don’t matter. 

For UWU:\
DH = 314, Crit = 318, DET = 318, SkS = 217 *4 points are moved from DH cap to SkS to reach an extra GCD tier (2.46 vs. 2.47)
