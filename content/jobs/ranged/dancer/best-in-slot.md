### Catch-all Gearset for other iLvl synced content (UCoB / UWU / Unreal Trials)

[Catch-All Gearset](https://etro.gg/gearset/8e76dbd9-6828-45d1-ae6b-2d2051e2b09f) \
Use Smoked Chicken + Grade 4 Tincture of Dexterity

Not max DPS, but close enough for a catch-all gearset that uses most of current 5.4 BiS gear for synced encounters. Swaps out non-Crit gear pieces for pieces that have Crit. (When last checked, difference between this set and theoretical BiS is ~0.15% DPS difference)

## What to do with ilvl 535 DNC Relic

It’s BiS for current savage content and for old iLvl synced content.

### For current level 80 content:

If you are missing other items for BiS, a good starting point is maxing Crit and DH and putting the rest in DET. You can min/max your relic for your needs by plugging your gear into <https://etro.gg/> and watching for wasted secondary stats.\
To minimize wasted stats, reallocate secondary stats from Crit that go above current stat tier into DET and then adjust DET/DH distribution until total wasted secondary stats is less than 6.\
Keep in mind you'll have to do this every time you get a gear upgrade. Staying with max Crit / max DH / rest DET while gearing up is fine too.

For 5.55 BiS: (see gearset in BiS section)\
DH = 358, Crit = 523, DET = 301, SkS = 0

For TEA: (see gearset in TEA section)\
DH = 346, Crit = 452, DET = 384, SkS = 0

For UCoB:\
DH = 280, Crit = 342, DET = 280, SkS = 280 *Caps all 4 stats so the last 62 points don’t matter. 

For UWU:\
DH = 318, Crit = 318, DET = 318, SkS = 228 *Caps on DH / Crit / DET and rest in SkS

## iLvl 515 DNC Relic

### For current level 80 content:

Staying with max Crit / max DH / rest DET while gearing up is fine.

For TEA: (see gearset in TEA section)\
DH = 407, Crit = 452, DET = 308, SkS = 0 

For UCoB:\
DH = 280, Crit = 327, DET = 280, SkS = 280 *Caps on all 4 stats so last 47 points don’t matter. 

For UWU:\
DH = 314, Crit = 318, DET = 318, SkS = 217 *4 points are moved from DH cap to SkS to reach an extra GCD tier (2.46 vs. 2.47)
