  - question: Who do I Dance Partner?
    answer: >-
      *This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum. This is the recommended partner
      priority list. (Note: Some fights may favor certain dance partners over
      others based on phase timings, boss mechanics, or ability to hit multiple
      targets. For the old level synced content, these priorities are rough
      estimates based on FFLOGS data.)*

       ***Level 100 Priority***

      > SAM > PCT/RPR/VPR/MNK/NIN > DRG/BLM > RDM > SMN > MCH > BRD > DNC


      ***Level 90 Priority***﻿ (for DSR and TOP)


      > SAM/PCT > BLM > MNK/VPR/DRG > MCH/RPR/NIN > SMN/RDM > BRD > DNC


      ***Level 80 Priority*** (for TEA)


      > SAM > BLM > DRG/MNK > PCT > MCH > NIN/RDM/RPR/VPR/SMN > BRD > DNC


      ***Level 70 Priority*** (for UCOB and UWU)


      > SMN > MNK > BLM > DRG/VPR/PCT/SAM/RPR/NIN/RDM/MCH > BRD > DNC

  - question: What is BiS for old Ultimate fights?
    answer: >-
      With iLvl sync, you can max out on both secondary stats on a gear piece as
      long as that gear piece is above a certain iLvl based on the encounter's
      iLvl sync.


      Recommended Gearsets for these fights are items that are at the iLvl needed to max both secondaries and have Crit and either Det or DH.


      iLvl for max stats:

      **UCoB**: 470

      **UWU**: 500

      **TEA**: 600\

      **DSR**: 725\

      **TOP**: 755


      The best weapon UCoB, UWU, and TEA as iLvl synced fights is the iLvl 535 Save the Queen relic weapon "Blade's Euphoria" with specific stat allocation that maximizes how many secondary stats you can get for the fight:


      **UCoB**: 127 Crit, 127 Det, 123 DH, 90 SkS (four points from DH moved to SkS to match with a 2.46 GCD tier)

      **UWU**: 136 Crit, 136 Det, 132 DH, 63 SkS (four points from DH moved to SkS to match with a 2.47 GCD tier)

      **TEA**:  184 Crit, 184 Det, 99 DH, 0 SkS


      For DSR and TOP the best weapon is the iLvl 665 Manderville Relic weapon "Mandervillous Chakrams" with Crit and Det capped and DH as the smaller stat.


      **BiS Food**: Use current BiS Food

      **BiS Potion**: Use current BiS Potion

# DANCE PARTNER PRIORITY

This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum. This is the recommended partner priority list.\
Special Note: some fights may favor certain Dance Partners over others based on phases/mechanics or ability to hit multiple targets.

*Updated: January 19, 2021 to account for balance changes in patch 5.4.*

1. SAM
2. NIN
3. MNK / BLM (crit build)*
4. DRG / SMN
5. RDM
6. MCH
7. BRD
8. DNC

\*Data on BLM SpS build as a dance partner is not available due to length in time to reach BiS with this build as of this update, but value as a dance partner is believed to drop significantly between the two builds due to under utilization of Devilment.

This priority list was made based on interactions between all jobs and DNC buffs and by using the new Partner Calculator (created by @Hint) which is a useful tool to help determine who in a given log would be the best Dance Partner:

(It is strongly encouraged to use this tool with your own group's logs to help determine who would be the best Dance Partner).
