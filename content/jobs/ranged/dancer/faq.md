# DANCE PARTNER PRIORITY

This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum. This is the recommended partner priority list.\
Special Note: some fights may favor certain Dance Partners over others based on phases/mechanics or ability to hit multiple targets.

*Updated: January 19, 2021 to account for balance changes in patch 5.4.*

1. SAM
2. NIN
3. MNK / BLM (crit build)*
4. DRG / SMN
5. RDM
6. MCH
7. BRD
8. DNC

\*Data on BLM SpS build as a dance partner is not available due to length in time to reach BiS with this build as of this update, but value as a dance partner is believed to drop significantly between the two builds due to under utilization of Devilment.

This priority list was made based on interactions between all jobs and DNC buffs and by using the new Partner Calculator (created by @Hint) which is a useful tool to help determine who in a given log would be the best Dance Partner:

(It is strongly encouraged to use this tool with your own group's logs to help determine who would be the best Dance Partner).
