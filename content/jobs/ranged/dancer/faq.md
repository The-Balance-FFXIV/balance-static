  - question: Who do I Dance Partner?
    answer: >-
      SAM > RPR/MNK > DRG/SMN/BLM/NIN/RDM > MCH > BRD > DNC


      *Exact rankings list is currently unavailable until Hint's DNC Partner Calculator comes online for further analysis.
  - question: What is BiS for old Ultimate fights?
    answer: >-
      With ilvl sync, you can max out on both secondary stats on a gear piece as
      long as that gear piece is above a certain ilvl based on the encounter's
      ilvl sync.


      Recommended Gearsets for these fights are items that are at the ilvl needed to max both secondaries and have Crit and either Det or DH.


      ilvl for max stats:

      **UCoB**: 470

      **UWU**: 500

      **TEA**: 600


      The best weapon for all of these ilvl synced fights is the ilvl 535 Save the Queen relic weapon "Blade's Euphoria" with specific stat allocation that maximizes how many secondary stats you can get for the fight:


      **UCoB**: 127 Crit, 127 Det, 123 DH, 90 SkS (4 points from DH moved to SkS to match with a 2.46 GCD tier)

      **UWU**: 136 Crit, 136 Det, 132 DH, 63 SkS (4 points from DH moved to SkS to match with a 2.47 GCD tier)

      **TEA**:  184 Crit, 184 Det, 99 DH, 0 SkS


      **BiS Food**: Use current BiS Food

      **BiS Potion**: Use current BiS Potion

# DANCE PARTNER PRIORITY

This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum. This is the recommended partner priority list.\
Special Note: some fights may favor certain Dance Partners over others based on phases/mechanics or ability to hit multiple targets.

*Updated: January 19, 2021 to account for balance changes in patch 5.4.*

1. SAM
2. NIN
3. MNK / BLM (crit build)*
4. DRG / SMN
5. RDM
6. MCH
7. BRD
8. DNC

\*Data on BLM SpS build as a dance partner is not available due to length in time to reach BiS with this build as of this update, but value as a dance partner is believed to drop significantly between the two builds due to under utilization of Devilment.

This priority list was made based on interactions between all jobs and DNC buffs and by using the new Partner Calculator (created by @Hint) which is a useful tool to help determine who in a given log would be the best Dance Partner:

(It is strongly encouraged to use this tool with your own group's logs to help determine who would be the best Dance Partner).
