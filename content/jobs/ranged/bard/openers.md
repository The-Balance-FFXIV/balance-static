# Bard Openers

For all openers:

* Use Pitch Perfect at three stacks as able, Bloodletter as able, and Refulgent procs as you get them.
* Hold Barrage until the next GCD if you already have an Refulgent proc.
* The best potion as of 6.00 is high-quality Grade 5 Tincture of Dexterity.

# Opener FAQ

> *Is it really okay to use Radiant Finale for only 2% in the opener?*

Yes, by the next two-minute burst you will have gotten three more coda.

\--

> *Should I use Refulgent Arrow between Stormbite and Caustic Bite if I get a proc?*

No, getting both DoTs up as soon as possible is slightly better.

\--

> *I've heard about using Tinctures at two minutes, why is it here?*

This is just a default opener if you don't know the fight length. If you're certain the fight will last 8:30 or more (accounting for downtime), you will want to Tincture at two and eight minutes.
