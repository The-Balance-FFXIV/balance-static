# Standard Openers

There are a few other openers you will see around, but the two below are the main general-purpose intermediate options.

For all openers:

* Any given Burst Shot in the image could be Refulgent Arrow, or vice versa save for the one using Barrage.
* Use Pitch Perfect at three stacks as able, Heartbreak Shot as able, and Refulgent procs as you get them.
* Try to use your first skill as the countdown hits zero (not before). This is aimed at aligning buffs long-term.
* The best potion as of 7.3 is high-quality Grade 3 Gemdraught of Dexterity.

# Opener FAQ

> *Is it really okay to use Radiant Finale for only 2% in the opener?*

Yes, by the next two-minute burst you will have gotten three more coda.

\--

> *Should I use Refulgent Arrow between Stormbite and Caustic Bite if I get a proc?*

No, getting both DoTs up as soon as possible is slightly better.

\--

> *Should I burn Pitch Perfect at less than three stacks after the 24 (WM timer) proc?*

No, go ahead and wait for the 21 proc. Even though it will lose one buff, this is an overall gain.

\--

> *I've heard about using Gemdraughts at two minutes, why is it here?*

This is just a default opener if you don't know the fight length. If you're certain the fight will last 8:30 or more (accounting for downtime), you will want to Tincture at two and eight minutes.
