# Opener FAQ


> *Why are Barrage and Sidewinder delayed?*

To make sure all party-wide buffs are up before they get used. If your group has everything up a bit sooner, go ahead and use the skills then.



> *Should I use Refulgent Arrow between Stormbite and Caustic Bite if I get a proc?*

No, getting both DoTs up is top priority.



> *Why are the openers different at different GCDs?*

The GCD makes a meaningful difference in how far the end of WM is going to move (within the oGCD window) from its original cast. As a result, whether we want WM to be the first or second oGCD varies. Also, at a faster GCD a 13-GCD Tincture becomes more feasible.

# Single target FAQ


> *When should I use Raging Strikes after the opener?*

A couple of GCDs into Minuet. This is to cover as much Pitch Perfect potential as possible.



> *When do I use my second/third potion?*

Try to cover Raging Strikes and Barrage with it. That damage spike is bigger than any heap of party buffs. If you can, also try to pop it right before an Iron Jaws, so that you can IJ at the end and get two runs of buffed DoTs.



> *Should I use Iron Jaws at the start and end of Raging Strikes?*

No, this isn't worth it. Try to use Iron Jaws once under each Raging - when either Raging or your DoTs are about to end.



> *When should I use Apex Arrow?*

As soon as you hit 100 gauge. You can hold it 1-2 GCDs, or use it at 90-95, if it lets you catch some buffs.



> *Should I hold Empyreal Arrow under Army's Paeon?*

Only if you're within ~2s of starting Wanderer's Minuet. Otherwise, fire away - you get 2 EAs under each Minuet/Ballad regardless.



> *Can I do anything with Enhanced Army's Paeon?*

If you have a little skill speed, you can set up a clean last-moment WM to MB transition:  
**Burst Shot > Pitch Perfect > Mages Ballad > Burst Shot**  

To do this, you MUST wait to press WM until late in the weaving window, AND avoid any GCD delays while in Minuet. Normally, your transition will look like:   
**Burst Shot  .. Wanderers Minuet > Burst Shot > Burst Shot > Raging Strikes > Burst Shot**

Failure to wait a tad on that WM, or clipping under Muse, may result in that last-moment PP "ghosting" - animating without actually going off or going on cooldown.



> *Should I macro <any damage skill>?*

No. Macros cannot be queued in advance, so you lose casts over time by using them since every use will have a little delay.

Targeting macros (`<tt>`, `<2>`, and so on) for Nature's Minne and Warden's Paean are ok, since the time you lose to not queueing can be gained back by not having to target a party member manually.

# AoE FAQ


> *How many DoTs should I put up?*

It's complicated. The full guide (link here) goes into the details.  
But as a very general rule of thumb, any DoT that will run most to all of its 30s (i.e. the mob won't die soon) is worth applying.



> *How does Shadowbite's damage work?*

It's based on the DoTs on the primary target, so you only need both DoTs on that one enemy.



> *Should I use Apex sooner when I have a lot of DoTs running?*

Yes, 85 to 90 is pretty fine depending on DoT count to lessen the risk of overfilling the gauge.

# Stats FAQ


> *What do I put in my relic?*

If you have the 535 AND the rest of the best in slot gear, or if you're using it for an Ultimate, check Gear Sets for details.  
Otherwise, follow the basic priority [in the Stats and Materia guide].



> *Is piece x better than piece y?*

The higher item level piece is better. If they're the same ilvl, the one with better substats (see priorities above) is better.  
A piece with more total substats (i.e. five meld slots) can be better than one the next ilvl step up, but usually they're roughly equal at best and you lose HP for it. 



> *Should I pentameld my crafted gear?*

Pentamelding is only worth the gil sink if you're working on a Savage tier shortly after it releases. At this stage, you're better off talking to Hillicen to upgrade your crafted gear to i520 instead.
