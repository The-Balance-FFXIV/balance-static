| ![bs](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002618_hr1.png)           | Burst Shot (BS)      | Your go-to filler GCD on single targets. Use Burst Shot when you have no other GCDs you need to press.                                                                                                                                           |
| ![ra](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002616_hr1.png)           | Refulgent Arrow (RA) | Refulgent Arrow is usable when you have the "Hawk's Eye" buff. You can get this buff by using Burst Shot, Stormbite, Caustic Bite, Iron Jaws, or Ladonsbite. Barrage also enables a usage.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![stormbite](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002614_hr1.png)    | Stormbite (SB)       | Damage over time (DoT) debuffs deal damage every three seconds. Keep Stormbite up on single target fights. Also, toss it on high HP dungeon mobs, or pepper them as they're being pulled/gathered if you can't hit 3+ enemies with Ladonsbite yet.                                                     |
| ![caustic bite](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002613_hr1.png) | Caustic Bite (CB)    | Damage over time debuffs deal damage every three seconds. Keep Caustic Bite up on single target fights. Toss it on high HP dungeon mobs, or if you're still on the run after tossing Stormbites around between packs.                                                               |
| ![iron jaws](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002608_hr1.png)    | Iron Jaws (IJ)       | Iron Jaws behaves the same as applying a brand new pair of DoTs. Including 'snapshotting' any buff or debuff values. Make sure to use it once during each two minute buff window. |
| ![apex arrow](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002619_hr1.png)   | Apex Arrow (AA)          | Apex Arrow is best used roughly once per minute, so that every other use falls under the two minute buff window. If this means sitting at 100 gauge at the end of Army's Paeon, that's okay.                                                           |
| ![Blast Arrow](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002621_hr1.png)   | Blast Arrow (BA)          | Blast Arrow becomes available after using Apex Arrow at 80+ gauge. The enemy you target is the one that takes 600 potency.                                                           |
| ![Blast Arrow](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002624_hr1.png)   | Resonant Arrow (ResA)          | Resonant Arrow becomes available after using Barrage. The enemy you target is the one that takes 600 potency.                                                           |
| ![Radiant Encore](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002100_hr1.png)   | Radiant Encore (RE)          | Radiant Encore becomes available after using Radiant Finale. Its potency scales with the coda spent on Finale, so it is weaker in the opener and our biggest single hit later on.                                                           |
| ![Ladonsbite](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002620_hr1.png)           | Ladonsbite (LB)      | Ladonsbite is your go-to filler GCD on two or more targets. The cone is very large, so don't stress too much about exactly where it's aimed.                                                                          |
| ![SHADBITE](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002617_hr1.png)       | Shadowbite (ShB)         | Usable when you have "Hawk's Eye", effectively our AoE Refulgent Arrow. The radius on ShB is a standard five yalms, so it covers a lot less space than Ladonsbite. Be mindful not to be targeting an enemy on the fringe of the pack when you use this. |

| ![WM icon](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002607_hr1.png)        | Wanderer’s Minuet (WM) |  Your strongest song. While in WM, procs give you stacks of Pitch Perfect. You'll be using your two minute buffs during this song. Leave WM with 3 or less seconds remaining.           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ![pp](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002611_hr1.png)             | Pitch Perfect (PP)     | Use Pitch Perfect at three stacks by default, or if a slate of buffs (or Minuet itself) is about to expire.                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![mb icon](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002602_hr1.png)        | Mage’s Ballad (MB)     | Our second-best song. While in MB, procs will reduce the cooldown of Heartbreak Shot and Rain of Death.                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![heartbreak](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002623_hr1.png)		| Heartbreak Shot (HBS)       | You can store up to three Heartbreaks, so you don't need to be in a hurry to use it unless you're close to full. Try to store these up during Army's Paeon to have a bunch to fire off during the two minute buff window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![ROD](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002605_hr1.png)            | Rain of Death (RoD)    | Rain of Death has a larger radius than most circle AoEs, so you don't always need to be targeting the dead center of a pack to hit everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![AP icon](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002603_hr1.png)        | Army’s Paeon (AP)      | While in AP, procs will gradually speed up your global cooldown and autoattacks, up to four times. It's subtle, so be careful not to fall behind. Try to avoid double weaving while at four stacks. Expect to leave AP as soon as WM is back up.|
| ![EAP](https://xivapi.com/i/005000/005314_hr1.png)            | Enhanced Army’s Paeon  | The song you use after Army's Paeon will get a smaller speed buff (12% at full stacks) for 10 seconds. The "Ethos" buff just allows you to have Army's run out while still getting speed on the next song. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It enables and enhances Refulgent Arrow (triples its hits) and Shadowbite (potency increase). It can no longer be consumed by other skills, nor does it compete with existing Hawk's Eye procs.                                                                                                                                  |
| ![raging strikes](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000352_hr1.png) | Raging Strikes (RS) | You'll use Raging Strikes along with your two minute party buffs (Battle Voice and Radiant Finale). Ideal timing varies, but in most bursts it should be used in the gcd before or after, with the two party buffs double woven together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![sidewinder](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002610_hr1.png)     | Sidewinder (SW)     | A simple damage button. Keep Sidewinder on cooldown so that every other one lands within two minute buffs.                                                          |

| ![battle voice](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002601_hr1.png) | Battle Voice (BV)  | A simple two minute party buff. Use Battle Voice during The Wanderer's Minuet.      |
| ![Radiant Finale](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002622_hr1.png) | Radiant Finale (RF)  | Despite the coda system and slightly shorter cooldown, you can safely treat Radiant Finale as a second two minute party buff. Use it alongside Battle Voice.      |
| ![troub](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002612_hr1.png)        | Troubadour (Troub) | Standard defensive utility for ranged dps. Use Troubadour when there's a lot of damage incoming on the party.                                        |
| ![NM](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002615_hr1.png)           | Nature’s Minne     | Bard's second two-minute defensive cooldown. Use Nature's Minne to help with periods of heavy healing.                                                                                                |
| ![SW](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000821_hr1.png)           | Second Wind        | If you make a mistake or otherwise end up at lower hp than the rest of the party, Second Wind can help patch things up.                                                                                                                                                   |
| ![AL](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000822_hr1.png)           | Arm’s Length       | Prevents most knockbacks. Can make certain mechanics a lot easier, even if we have full mobility.                                                          |
| ![hg](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000848_hr1.png)           | Head Graze         | Cancels enemy casts that have a shaking red bar. Most things you're expected to cancel will have long cast times.                                                                                                                                       |
| ![REPELL SHOT](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000366_hr1.png)  | Repelling Shot     |  Repelling Shot is sometimes a useful way to do a snap movement. Note that it doesn't take you back as far as some other jobs' back jumps.                                                                                                           |
| ![WP](https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002609_hr1.png)           | The Warden’s Paean | Cleanses any debuff with a little white bar over the icon. These don't appear often at endgame, but keep an eye out anyway. In most cases, Warden's can even prevent a debuff in advance. |
| ![Pelo](https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000844_hr1.png)         | Peloton            | Makes the group run faster. Mostly nice for dungeons, but you can help melee out by popping it pre-pull in trials / raids too.                                                                                    |
