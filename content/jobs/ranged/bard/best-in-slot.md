      This is the default recommendation. You can swap the Skill Speed materia
      for a Direct Hit if you want to play at 2.50, or put it in the bow instead
      if you want easier cross-ranged compatibility.


      Similarly, swap a second Direct Hit for a Skill Speed if you'd like to run 2.48.

# For level 70 Ultimates:

Any gear that's i470 or higher will suffice, as it syncs down to maximum substats for UWU. You can get some bonus value out of a 515/535 relic by keeping its substats at 318/280 or less (for UWU/UCoB). 

Outside of that, it's really not worth trying to min-max your gear for these. The DPS checks are trivial -- every minute spent chasing .1% more damage is better spent re-reading a guide or watching a video.

# Gear Set FAQ

> *Why is there skill speed? I thought it was bad?*

First, Bard benefits from having a little skill speed in order to avoid timing issues created by Enhanced Armys Paeon / Army's Muse.

From there, it's a matter of substat efficiency - substats add value in tiers, with speed in particular having very large ones. Even as a weak(er) stat, it's better not to waste points of skill speed by having way more than you need to hit a tier.

> *Why are there Determination melds?*

Smoked Chicken requires a certain amount of Det to make full use out it. Also, more tiering -- it's better to go up three tiers of Det than to add +60 DH.
