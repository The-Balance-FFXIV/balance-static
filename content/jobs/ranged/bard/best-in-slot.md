      We recommend you purchase the tome bracelet first, then boots, then
      pants. 


      The order of the last three pieces can depend on your loot rolls, etc. But if you're upgrading from pentamelds, the accessories will be slightly better upgrades than the hat.


      Note the food and the SkS meld in the bow. This is to hit 2.48 with the best possible efficiency, which we like for some advanced rotational reasons. See [Frequently Asked Questions](/jobs/ranged/bard/faq/) for details until the advanced guide is ready.

# For level 70 Ultimates:

Any gear that's i470 or higher will suffice, as it syncs down to maximum substats for UWU. You can get some bonus value out of a 515/535 relic by keeping its substats at 318/280 or less (for UWU/UCoB). 

Outside of that, it's really not worth trying to min-max your gear for these. The DPS checks are trivial -- every minute spent chasing .1% more damage is better spent re-reading a guide or watching a video.

# Gear Set FAQ

> *Why is there skill speed? I thought it was bad?*

First, Bard benefits from having a little skill speed in order to avoid timing issues created by Enhanced Armys Paeon / Army's Muse.

From there, it's a matter of substat efficiency - substats add value in tiers, with speed in particular having very large ones. Even as a weak(er) stat, it's better not to waste points of skill speed by having way more than you need to hit a tier.

> *Why are there Determination melds?*

Smoked Chicken requires a certain amount of Det to make full use out it. Also, more tiering -- it's better to go up three tiers of Det than to add +60 DH.
