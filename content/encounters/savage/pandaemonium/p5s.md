## Major Mechanics

Proto-Carbuncle has a hard enrage of 10:10 into the encounter and requires roughly 49k raid DPS to defeat before then.

### Pre-pull Preparation

Assign all players clock spots with DPS on intercardinals, tanks north and south, and healers east and west. Players should also be split into two light party groups containing one tank, one healer and two DPS. On top of this, players need to assign roles to specific, cardinal puddles to be used for the Devour mechanic later - assign one role (tank, healer, melee, ranged) to each cardinal.

### Mechanic Overview

**Sonic Howl**

A moderate raidwide AoE that deals magical damage.

**Ruby Glow**

A heavy raidwide AoE that deals magical damage and summons magical barriers to split the arena. These can either divide the arena in half diagonally or into four quadrants. Any damage that **Searing Ray** or **Topaz Stones** does will be reflected by these walls, dealing additional damage in the area called **Ruby Reflection** and afflicting anyone hit with a damage down debuff.

**Venomous Mass**

A tankbuster that deals magical AoE damage to the first aggro, applying an uncleansable, 12 second long poison DoT and a physical vulnerability up debuff.

**Toxic Crunch**

A tankbuster that deals single target physical damage to the first aggro, applying an uncleansable 12-second long poison DoT. This always follows Venomous Mass, forcing a tank swap during the Venomous Mass cast.

**Topaz Stones**

Spawns Topaz Stones which deal magical damage in a small area. This magical damage will be reflected by Ruby Glow barriers. Stones can also be poisoned and will slowly expand if so.

**Topaz Cluster**

Spawns multiple Topaz Stones in quick succession.

**Toxicosis**

Spawns four poison puddles that deal moderate damage over time whilst standing inside them, with a timer indicating when it needs to be soaked by two players. If two players are not inside the tower when it resolves, it will deal heavy damage to the closest player and spawn a Lively Bait add, which will cast Scatterbait, a heavy raidwide that afflicts all targets with a damage down. 

**Double Rush**

Proto-Carbuncle will jump to the centre of the room and dash to a random intercardinal, hitting all players in front of it and applying a physical vulnerability up. It will proceed to dash back to the opposite intercardinal, hitting every player with heavy physical damage and knocking them back to its side. The knockback can be prevented with **Arm's Length** and **Surecast**.

**Venom Squall**

This cast will do three things back-to-back:

1. Untelegraphed, small AoEs on all players dealing magical damage
2. A baited ground AoE on all players
3. Untelegraphed stack markers on both healers dealing magical damage

**Venom Surge**

This cast will do three things back-to-back:

1. Untelegraphed stack markers on both healers, dealing magical damage
2. A baited ground AoE on all players
3. Untelegraphed, small AoEs on all players, dealing magical damage

**Raging Tail**

Proto-Carbuncle will do a 180-degree swipe behind it once. Getting hit by this applies a damage down debuff.

**Raging Claw**

Proto-Carbuncle will do a 180-degree slash in front of it six times. Getting hit by this applies a damage down debuff.

**Claw to Tail**

Proto-Carbuncle will do a wind-up 180-degree slash in front of it, hitting six times in total. This is immediately followed by a fast 180-degree swipe behind the boss. Getting hit by this applies a damage down debuff. 

**Tail to Claw**

Proto-Carbuncle will do a fast 180-degree swipe behind it. This is immediately followed by a wind-up 180-degree slash in front of it**.** Getting hit by this applies a damage down debuff. 

**Venom Pool**

Untelegraphed stack markers on both healers, dealing magical damage. Placing these stacks on top of **Topaz Stones** will break them and turn them into the poison variant.

**Searing Ray** 

Proto-Carbuncle will cleave the arena in front of it with magical damage. This cast **will** be reflected by **Ruby Glow** barriers.

**Raging Claw**

Proto-Carbuncle will cleave the arena in front of it with physical damage. This cast will **not** be reflected by **Ruby Glow** barriers.

**Sonic Shatter**

Five back-to-back instances of moderate magical raidwide damage in quick succession.

**Starving Stampede**

This is the main mechanic of the fight, colloquially referred to as **Devour**. Proto-Carbuncle will telegraph eight jump locations across the arena, marking them sequentially with a red jaw marker, showing the order that it will jump in. Each time the boss jumps, it does a large AoE, inflicting Down for the Count when hit. Once the jumps are over, the boss will cast Devour on all players hit, eating and killing them.

## Fight Strategy

### Ruby Glow 1

As the fight begins, Proto-Carbuncle will immediately start with **Sonic Howl** followed by **Ruby Glow**, so mitigate and heal in between the two raidwides. After the first Ruby Glow cast, the arena will be divided into four quadrants. Two **Topaz Stones** will make two quadrants unsafe and two expanding poison pools will spawn, cutting players off from different parts of the room. Head to one of the quadrants that doesn't have a Topaz Stone in it and won't be hit by the expanding poison.

After the poison puddles disappear, the boss will cast **Venomous Pool** into **Toxic Crunch**, a sequence that's repeated several times in this fight. The current main tank needs to move away from the party and use mitigation, as Venomous Pool deals damage in an AoE around the target. During the Venomous Pool castbar, the off tank needs to provoke and use mitigation to take the **Toxic Crunch**.
