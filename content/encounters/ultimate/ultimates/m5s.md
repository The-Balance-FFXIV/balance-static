## Mechanic Details

**Deep Cut** 

* 2 conal tankbusters on the highest aggro target

**Flip to A-Side/B-Side**

* The boss will store a mechanic that is released when he casts his next **Twist & Drop the Needle**. If he casts **Flip to A-Side**, he will store 3 conal AoEs baited on a random player of each role (1 tank, 1 healer, 1 DPS). If he casts **Flip to B-Side**, he will store 2 rectangular cleaves that will bait on to one healer each.

**X-Snap Twist & Drop the Needle**

* Boss will cast **2-Snap, 3-Snap, or 4-Snap Twist**. He will raise his hand and one half of the room will be lit by squares coming from the bos. This side of the room will be cleaved twice if he casts **2-Snap**, three times is he casts **3-Snap**, and four times if he casts **4-Snap**. After these cleaves, the boss will quickly cleave the side that was not originally targeted.
* **Drop the Needle** will release the stored **A-Side/B-Side** (role groups or light parties) mechanic.
* A full resolution will involve dodging all of the half-room cleaves, swapping to the other half of the room, and resolving **A-Side/B-Side** baits.

**Celebrate Good Times**

* Raidwide damage

**Disco Infernal**

* Raidwide damage that triggers **Funky Floors** and assigns all players a timed debuff

**Funky Floors**

* Squares on the floor will be marked as unsafe (orange) or safe (not orange). These squares form a checkerboard, alternating pattern on the floor. If players are clipped by the unsafe square, they take damage and receive a damage down.
* 8 spotlights spawn on the map. At any given time, 4 of them will cover safe squares and 4 will cover unsafe squares.
* Players will receive a Disco debuff from the **Disco Infernal** cast. When the timer expires, they must be in a spotlight by themselves to cleanse the debuff. Failure to cleanse the debuff will result in death. Debuffs are applied to players at the same time, and **all DPS players have the same duration while all support players** (tanks/healers) **have the same duration**. When this debuff expires, players will be locked in place to perform a dance animation.
* Players must identify when their debuff expires and cleanse their debuff by finding a spotlight (as selected by team and strategy) that is on a safe square when their debuff expires. As you can't move immediately following the debuff expiration, you must preposition to cleanse your debuff in a safe spotlight.

**Outside In/Inside Out**

* If the boss casts **Outside In**, players need to start in his hitbox ring to dodge an initial hit and move to max melee to dodge a second hit.
* If the boss casts **Inside Out**, players need to start at max melee to dodge an initial hit and move into his hitbox ring to dodge a second hit.

**Ensemble Assemble**

* Frogs begin to spawn north of the arena to telegraph their upcoming cleaves. The direction a frog is pointing will indicate which side of the room will be cleaved. These cleaves do not occur until after the upcoming **Arcadey Night Fever** sequence.
* When he first casts this, frogs can only cleave the left and right halves of the arena. The next time he casts this, frogs can cleave the north, south, east, and west halves.

**Arcadey Night Fever**

* The boss will telegraph a yellow, unsafe circle around him. Players must start outside of this circle. After he casts the initial circle, players will need to step into his hitbox to dodge a hit on the outside of his hitbox. This is similar to **Inside Out/Outside In** and layered with additional conal baits. Players must alternate moving in and out through the duration of the mechanic. **The first safe spot is always out of his hitbox, and the final safe spot is always in his hitbox**.
* While the in/out cleaves are occurring, the boss will cast one conal cleave on each player. This will alternate by role (1 DPS, 1 support, 1 DPS, 1 support...) until all 8 players have been hit once. **After a player is hit, that same spot will be hit in addition to the player of another role.** As such, players should spread out in a way that enables an initial hit, a dodge towards someone of the same role, and a return to their original position while also performing the in/out. Each player will be hit one time.
* When a player is hit, they'll receive a timed A/B debuff. The first person hit will always receive the same timer and opposite letter as the final person hit. **1-8, 2-7, 3-6, and 4-5 are pairs for the upcoming mechanic**.

**Let's Dance**

* Dancing Green will tether to the frogs from west to east. Each frog will cleave one half of the room according to where they are pointing in succession.
* During these cleaves, the player timers are expiring. When your timer expires, you must be stacked tightly with your opposite-letter partner **(1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5)**. If you are not stacked with your partner, you will receive a bleed, initial damage, and fail the check for this mechanic. If you are stacked with others that are not your partner, they will take the initial damage and receive a magic vuln stack that will kill them when their debuffs expire.
* **NOTE:** Debuffs only exist the first time you see the **Arcadey Night** sequence.

**Let's Pose!**

* Successful execution of **Arcadey Night Fever** and **Let's Dance** will give you a slight damage buff. If every party member does both of these mechanics correctly, the party will receive 1 full LB bar.

**Quarter Beat/Eighth Beat**

* If the boss casts **Quarter Beat**, players must stand in pairs. This is targeted on all supports or all DPS.
* If the boss casts **Eighth Beat**, players must spread. These small AoEs are baited on every party member.

**Ride the Waves**

* Boss will bring lines of colored squares down from the north slowly. These squares are unsafe. The pattern of safe/unsafe squares will create lanes for the party to stand in. Parties should stand in groups of 4 per lane (2 DPS, 2 supports) to resolve the **Quarter/Eighth Beat** that occurs at the same time.

**Frogtourage 1**

* Boss will create frogs that skate around the arena. The areas that these frogs enclose while skating will be unsafe. Based on how they skate, 4 squares will be safe on the **North and South** OR **East and West**. Players should split into light parties to effectively resolve the **Quarter/Eighth Beat** that occurs after the skating.

**Disco Infernal 2**

* Players will receive timed debuffs like they did in **Funky Floors**. Again, 4 supports will have one timer and 4 DPS will have another. To resolve the debuff, players must be standing in a spotlight when their timer expires.
* At the same time, 4 frogs spawn. Whichever role is not actively cleansing in the spotlight needs to stand close to the frogs to bait conal AoEs away from the spotlights.
* If DPS cleanse first, supports bait first. Roles will swap after initial cleaves.

**Frogtourage 2**

* The boss will spawn 2 frogs in the arena that indicate half-room cleaves. These 2 cleaves together indicate that **1/4 of the arena will be safe as each pair of cleaves resolves.** The boss will also cast a half-room cleave following two pairs.
* At the end of the mechanic, the boss will cast a half-room cleave in conjunction with a pair of frog cleaves. This leaves **1/8 of the room safe**.
* Frogs will skate around the arena again. This time, they will leave the middle of the room safe or the outside of the room safe.
* 4 frogs will spawn and shoot conal AoEs baited on the closest target.
* If middle is safe, all players must stand inside the safe area and the 4 baiters need to shoot cones away from the rest of the party. Afterwards, the safe spot will flip and the other 4 members of your party will need to bait cones away from the rest of your party.

**Funky Floors 2**

* Same as the first, but with **Quarter/Eighth Beat** resolutions instead of spotlights.

**HI-NRG Fever**

* Enrage
