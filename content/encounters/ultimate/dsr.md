Dragonsong’s Reprise is the fourth Ultimate to be released in FFXIV. Added in Patch 6.11, the fight is mechanically fast-paced and features multiple strict DPS checks on patch. It can be unlocked at the Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan (X:12.7, Y:14.2) after completing Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage).

# Introduction

**Everything here is subject to change as I learn more about specificities of strats, see more of how different groups perform different mechanics, and figure out what works best in terms of document formatting.** I hope this document proves useful to your early prog while we’re all trying to figure out this fight! Needless to say, ***heavy spoilers ahead.*** Continue at your own risk if you’re looking to go blind.

I will be updating this document frequently with new phases and their respective mechanics as I see and understand them.

Currently working on: Phase 5 and Phase 6

Let me know if anything’s wrong, if there are any inconsistencies, or if you have suggestions for areas of improvement in the doc on Discord at Nashira#0615.

# Phase 1: The Vault Bosses

The first phase of the fight will have you facing the original trio from The Vault dungeon in Heavensward: Ser Adelphel, Ser Grinnaux, and Ser Charibert. Clearing this phase will trigger a checkpoint and cause further pulls in the instance to begin at Thordan. The limit bar gauge will be capped at two bars in this phase. 

Another thing worth noting is that throughout the entire fight, if you fail to execute a mechanic correctly but survive, you will be afflicted with a 50% damage down that lasts three minutes.

A possible setup for markers is as follows:

![Possible Markers](/img/encounters/ultimate/image57.png)

## Phase 1 Setup

First, establish where people will bait the Hyperdimensional Slash earthshakers.

One example setup could be to have t/h take outer baits, and dps take inner baits, with casters of both groups always planting in order to minimise people over adjusting and clipping each other. Another example setup would be to order players in a line and the order of the markers from left to right will take the waymarks behind them from left to right.

Light Party setups can be helpful going into the last mechanic of this phase, Pure of Heart. You could assign 1 light party to have left protean baits and the other to grab right protean baits.

## Phase 1 Mechanics

**Things to Note:**

This is primarily a two boss phase consisting of Ser Grinnaux and Ser Adelphel. They’ll need to be tanked by separate tanks but they can be stacked together for double target damage.

Keep a close eye on their health percentages. If one is killed before the other, then they’ll cast Bull’s Steel/Brightblade’s Steel and become impossible to kill. The cast time is *very* quick. Make sure to have them both at about a 1% difference before burning them down.

**Holiest of Holy**

Heavy Raidwide from Adelphel.

**Empty Dimension**

Donut/Dynamo AOE on Ser Grinnaux’s position.

**Full Dimension**

Out/Chariot AOE on Ser Grinnaux’s position.

**Heavensblaze**

A tether appears on a random player. This needs to be grabbed by a tank for the following tankbuster and heavily mitigated. The party and the non-tethered tank will need to stack up and mitigate the following shared aoe.

**Hyperdimensional Slash**

2 sets of earthshaker markers will randomly target 4 people each. Each set of 4 marked players will be shot with a wide line aoe that will spawn a portal at its edge. At the same time, the unmarked people will be hit by a conal aoe targeted randomly on an unmarked player. If the portals are too close to each other then they will tether to each other and detonate, causing a wipe. If a player is too close to a portal, it will tether to them and kill them instantly.

**Faith Unmoving**

Ser Grinnaux knocks back all players relative to his location

**Holiest of Holy 2**

Ser Adelphel will spawn on a random cardinal edge, cast a holiest of holy raidwide and begin dashing 4 times, spawning orbs in his path which kill those that are hit. After the 4 dashes, Adelphel strikes the highest enmity target with a small aoe tankbuster. These orbs can tether to the portals from the previous mechanic and will detonate, wiping the party.

Ser Adelphel’s dash pattern goes cw/ccw, across, opposite of the first movement (cw/ccw), then across again. This pattern takes an hourglass shape.

**Holiest Hallowing**

Ser Adelphel will begin casting a heal on Ser Grinnaux, this needs to be interrupted or Ser Grinnaux will recover 30% of his hp.

**Heavensflame**

4 pairs of symbols will appear on 8 random players. These indicate the player pairs that will be chained soon after. These chains need to be broken immediately by distance or both chained players will begin receiving heavy damage.

Soon after, every player will be hit with individual circular aoes that deal heavy damage, and afflicting them with a magic vuln up. These will kill others if they overlap.

DPS will get: two circles, one triangle, and one square.

Tanks will get: one square, one cross.

Healers will get: one triangle, one cross.

**The Bull’s Steel & Brightblade’s Steel**

Soft enrage. Damage buff & full heal for both Grinnaux and Adelphel if cast goes off. Ser Grinnaux will then immediately start casting a Full Dimension, killing everyone at the end of the cast. This happens when one of Ser Grinnaux or Ser Adelphel dies too soon before the other or after a certain period of time as a soft enrage.

**Haurchefant**

Haurchefant will block Ser Zephirin’s spear outside of the circle during Pure of Heart, receiving damage until death and creating raidwide shockwaves during each tick while alive. He will also gain an infirmity debuff which reduces his health regeneration from external sources by 100%.

**Pure of Heart**

DPS Check. Ser Grinnaux will chain everyone within a small circle, exiting this circle will kill you instantly. Meanwhile, Ser Charibert will begin casting Pure of Heart. Once his cast finishes he will deal damage to players proportional to the % of his remaining health. Bring him below ~20% for transition to the next phase.

Two players at a time will be targeted by protean waves baited on the closest players. Players hit by the protean will later receive a 5s Skyblind debuff and drop a twister/stepped leader at their location when the timer hits 0, dealing heavy damage to those in it. These can be baited away from the initial protean position.

## Phase 1 Strats

**Beginning:**

Stack both bosses together in the middle with the party at south and at max melee. 

**Holiest of Holy:**

Raidwide. Need to just mitigate and shield through this.

**Empty Dimension & Heavensblaze:**

Donut, Tank Tether, Shared AoE. The party will stack south right outside of Ser Grinnaux’s hitbox. One of the two tanks will move south to grab the tether and head to the opposite side of the hitbox of the party while the other tank stacks with the party. The tethered tank will need heavy mitigation while the party will need at least 2 mitigations & shields to survive the shared aoe.

If the tethered tank is finding it difficult to grab the tether, they can pull Adelphel slightly north of Grinnaux to increase the tether distance from the party. Just keep in mind the size of the Empty Dimension donut.

**Hyperdimensional Slash:**

4 players will be targeted with line earthshakers, players with these markers will position themselves starting either north/south toward corners, being careful not to be too close to others or too close to the bosses so as to not get cleaved by the earthshaker. Meanwhile, unmarked players will stack opposite of the marked players to receive a cleave targeted randomly on one of the unmarked players.

Once the first set is done, the unmarked players will then be marked and do the same thing on their side and vice versa.

Since the DPS check for this phase is quite lenient, for prog reasons and for consistency, try to always place yourself right on the marker to ensure the lines don’t stray too far from the corners.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image60.png)

Example: Hyperdimensional Slash

**Faith Unmoving & Holiest of Holy:**

Identify the cardinal direction Ser Adelphel is, move opposite of him and pop knockback resistance. Ser Adelphel will cast a Holiest of Holy raidwide and begin dashing. The raidwide may catch people off guard, remember to mitigate this as needed when getting into your initial positions.

Once he does his first dash either clockwise or ccw, move toward the arrow on the arena in the direction of his first dash and remain there until the mechanic resolves, it should be safe through all of the dashes and orb explosions, just be careful of your distance to the portals that you dropped previously.

The tank with enmity on Adelphel will then need to move out of the party since he will finish the dashes with Execution, a heavy hitting tankbuster with a small AoE that knocks back anyone else that’s hit. The Adelphel tank can just continue their movement past the arrows into where the orbs have finished exploding and heavily mitigate or invuln this hit. 

The person with the first interrupt should then prepare for when Adelphel becomes targetable while the tanks recenter the bosses for the next mechanic.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image19.png)

Example: Holiest of Holy 2 Safe Spot

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image39.png)

The exact tip of this arrow is always safe.

**Holiest Hallowing:**

First of the heals that come from Ser Adelphel, 3 of these will happen throughout P1 and must be interrupted so plan out the order of interrupts and call them out if necessary. The DPS check will be impossible if even one of these goes off. 

**Faith Unmoving & Heavensflame (AKA Playstation):**

Knockback into chains & individual aoes. There will be 4 random pairs of symbols above each person’s head. Start close to Grinnaux and opposite of your paired partner and get knocked back, then run slightly to the edge to ensure that your chains break and you’re not clipping anyone with the resulting spread aoe.

Boss positioning can drastically offset player positions and skew the knockback portion of this mechanic. To mitigate this, make sure you’re targeting Ser Grinnaux and position yourself based on his hitbox. Additionally, the knockback not being enough distance to break the chains may catch people off guard.

If people are dead before symbols are assigned, the extra symbol from the respective role will be randomly distributed to one of the remaining players.

DPS will get: **2** **circles**, **1 triangle**, and **1 square**.

Tanks will get: **1 square**, **1 cross**

Healers will get: **1 triangle**, **1 cross**

* Static Positions Strat:

Tanks will start North, DPS start Southeast, Healers start Southwest. This drastically reduces the amount of adjusting and thinking needed.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image22.png)

Initial Setups

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image48.png)

Final Positions

*Note:* If you’re a warrior, your Inner Release comes up at around this time so either delay it, use it pre-pull, or click off the knockback resistance portion. You can create a macro with /statusoff "Inner Strength" to help with this.

**Holiest Hallowing:**

2nd holiest hallowing cast, just be sure to target Adelphel and interrupt this if it’s your responsibility.

**Empty/Full Dimension & Holiest of Holy:**

Raidwide into in/out. Empty = In, Full = Out. 

Be careful of the casts here. The cast of the in/out will start, the Holiest of Holy AoE will occur, then the in/out will occur. They’re slightly staggered so don’t get baited by the aoe happening and think that the in/out is done.

Additionally, your healers may not have as many resources here so plan mits as needed.

**Holiest Hallowing:**

Last holiest hallowing cast, interrupt based on how you assigned them. Should be noted that whomever interrupted the first can interrupt this one.

**Holiest of Holy:**

Another raidwide, heal through this and mitigate as needed.

**Bull’s Steel & Brightblade’s Steel:**

Soft enrages cast by both Grinnaux and Adelphel. This cast is relatively quick so make sure they’re both at the same percentage before you burn them down.

**Pure of Heart (Hard Enrage):**

Once Adelphel and Grinnaux hit 0, Grinnaux chains everyone in a small circle and Charibert begins his cast. Leaving the circle kills you instantly so try not to leave it.

Players will start taking intermittent shockwaves as Haurchefant drops to 0 hp. Once he’s close to dying, Charibert will begin executing mechanics.

Charibert will protean cleave two of the closest players to him, applying a 5s Skyblind debuff which will drop a twister at the player’s current location after falling off. Determine your order, have the players bait, move out and drop their twister, then move back into the party and repeat until Charibert is brought low enough for the phase transition (below 30%). There’s a raidwide at the end before the transition so make sure people aren’t completely low. **Don’t forget about the last set of twisters.**

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image30.png)

Example Uptime Strat: Tanks bait first proteans, party stands off to the side in max melee range.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image15.png)

Tanks drop their stepped leader/twisters on opposite side at max melee once debuffs fall off, ranged move into place.

![alt_text](/img/encounters/ultimate/image50.png "image_tooltip")

Ranged move to the back to drop off their stepped leader/twister while melee move in to bait their proteans.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image34.png)

Melee move to the side max melee and drop off their stepped leader/twister while healers move in to bait their proteans.

# Phase 2: Thordan and the Knights of the Round

This phase has you fighting Thordan and the Knights of the Round, with Thordan becoming untargetable during Knights (trio) mechanics. Unlike previous ultimates, this fight features a checkpoint and further wipes in the instance will continue from Phase 2. The DPS check here isn’t too strict without deaths. Burst heavy jobs will perform well in this phase due to minute long downtime phases allowing for your cooldowns to become available. However, singular deaths during some mechanics can easily snowball into wipes if not recovered well. 

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image38.png)

Possible markers. Use the lines outside the edge of the arena to align your waymarks.

## Phase 2 Setup

Assign light parties for Strength of the Ward & Sanctity of the Ward or use the ones you had from Phase 1. You can also assign colours or directions to these parties to make it easier to split when needed.

Assign t/h and dps pairs for 2nd Trio on cardinals. 

## Phase 2 Mechanics

* Things to Note:

Thordan’s auto attacks cleave for heavy damage so be careful not to be in front of him in between mechanics during damage phases.

**Ascalon’s Mercy Concealed:**

Baited proteans on every player, stay close to the boss until the cast disappears and sidestep to avoid them.

**Ascalon’s Might:**

3 consecutive tankbuster cleaves at the highest enmity target. Mitigate as needed.

**Strength of the Ward:**

Thordan becomes untargetable and summons knights for the first combination mechanic.

The major mechanics in this are as follows:

* Spiral Thrust
* Lightning Storm
* Heavy Impact
* Ascalon’s Mercy Concealed

### Spiral Thrust

A knight appears at the edge and divebombs, cleaving through the arena in a wide line aoe. 3 of these will appear at cardinal, or intercardinal spots and eliminate 6/8 safe spots.

### Lightning Storm

Every player is hit with a spread AoE, applying a Lightning Resistance Down II debuff for 3s. These will kill any player that overlaps them.

### Heavy Impact

Ser Gerrique casts an earthquake with expanding rings, dodge into the aoes as they appear. Getting hit by an earthquake will stun you.

**First Trio: Dimensional Collapse & Conviction and The Dragon’s Rage:**

Thordan becomes untargetable and summons knights for another combination mechanic. 

The major mechanics in this are as follows:

* Dimensional Collapse
* Conviction
* The Dragon’s Rage
* Holy Shield Bash

### Dimensional Collapse

Expanding black circles will appear, being in these at the end of their expansion will kill you. There will be safe zones available at either cardinals or intercardinals for players to resolve later mechanics within. An easy method of determining safe edges is to be between two outer circles or at the edge of an inner one.

### Conviction (First Trio)

6 towers will appear and will need to be soaked by the end of the mechanic or the towers will deal heavy raidwide damage, in addition to inflicting paralysis and damage downs to anyone still alive.

### The Dragon’s Rage

3 players will receive blue defamation markers and will need to move to individual safe spots. Meanwhile, a shared AoE from Thordan will go off on one of the unmarked players. Players will need shields and mitigation to survive either of these.

### Holy Shield Bash

Two knights will spawn south relative to Thordan’s position and tether to random unmarked players. Both tanks will need to grab these tethers and move into the Thordan safe zone. The tethered targets and anyone in the path of the tether will be hit with a Shield Bash dealing heavy damage and afflicting Down for the Count for 5s. The tethered target will then be hit with multiple frontal cone cleaves.

**Ancient Quaga:**

Heavy Raidwide. Heal through this and mitigate as needed.

**Heavenly Heel:**

Tankswap at cast. Player with highest enmity receives a slashing resist down debuff then Thordan cleaves 3 times at the highest enmity target with Ascalon’s Might.

**Sanctity of the Ward:**

Thordan becomes untargetable and begins the next combined mechanic.

2 players will be targeted with 1 sword or a 2 sword marker. Additionally, 3 knights will appear. A dark knight, and two paladins opposite each other in the middle looking in opposite directions. 

The paladins will begin dashing throughout the arena 3 times total, leaving behind giant orbs that explode after a short time.

The dark knight will begin plunging at the players with the sword markers with a shared AoE, dealing less damage the further away they are. First toward the player with 1 sword, then at the player with 2 swords, back to the 1, then finishing with 2.

**The Dragon’s Gaze:**

Gaze attack originating from both a giant eye and Thordan at the edge of the arena, players will need to be looking away from both at the cast or be afflicted by Hysteria.

**Second Trio: Conviction & Hiemal Storm & Holy Comet and Heaven’s Stake:**

Thordan becomes untargetable and begins this last combined mechanic and probably the trickiest of this phase. To make things easier, this mechanic will be broken down into 2 parts.

Order of mechanics are as follows:

- - -

* Part 1:

4x Heaven’s Stake (puddles at consistent intercard locations) 

8x Conviction Towers (in random locations. 2-3 inside, 5-6 outside)

2x Holy Comet (prey on 2 random players of the same role)

4x Hiemal’s Storm (puddles baited on t/h or dps)

* Part 2:

7x Holy comets on the Prey marked players

Faith Unmoving (knockback)

8x Conviction Towers

- - - 

**Hiemal’s Storm:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part 1:</span> Either 4 t/h or 4 dps will be targeted with an unmarked Hiemal’s Storm, dropping a lingering shiva puddle at their location at the end of the cast. Move out of these quickly or you’ll receive a heavy bleed debuff and likely die.

**Holy Comet:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part 1:</span> 2 players of the same role, t/h or dps will receive a prey marker. Players with these markers will begin dropping meteors at their location 7 times and will need to move to prevent these meteors from dropping on themselves or an existing meteor. If a meteor lands on another, it will detonate and wipe the raid.

Unmarked players will need to move to designated positions, adjusting for prey marked players as needed, with a dps & t/h pair between each fire puddle to bait the shiva puddles. Unmarked players will then move to soak a Conviction tower. The prey marked players will need to soak the 2 designated 150-180° opposite towers.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part 2:</span> Once the first set of Conviction towers resolve, meteors will begin dropping on the prey players 7 times. These will inflict raidwide damage upon landing and will detonate an existing meteor or kill the prey player if they land directly on either.

**Heaven’s Stake:**

The edge of the arena will be targeted with an AoE donut, dealing damage to those within the aoe at the end of the cast. 4 lingering fire aoes will also drop on the intercardinal positions, dealing heavy damage to anyone that enters them.

**Conviction (Second Trio):**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part 1:</span> 8 Conviction towers will appear in random locations either in the centre or near the edge. There will always be 2-3 inner towers and 5-6 outer towers. Two of the outer towers will always be guaranteed to be 150° apart from each other in the worst case.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part 2:</span> 8 new Conviction towers will spawn at clock spots along the edge and the unmarked players will need to determine which tower they need to soak.

These need to be soaked by the end of the cast or they will detonate and wipe the raid.

**Faith Unmoving:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Part 2:</span> Ser Grinnaux appears in the centre and knocks back all players relative to his location.

**Ultimate End:**

Thordan becomes targetable at the North edge and begins the animation for Ultimate End, a heavy hitting raidwide that needs heavy mitigation and shielding in order to survive. This has no cast, so mitigate and shield during the animation.

**Broad Swing:**

At the end of the cast, Thordan cleaves 120° to his left/right, the opposite side from his first swing, then rear for heavy damage dependent on his current facing. Dodge from his rear to the side that was swung at after the first cleave. Getting hit by a swing will deal damage to the player and knock them back a far distance.

## Phase 2 Strats

**Beginning:**

Party starts stacked south of the boss while the main tank is on the opposite side.

**Ascalon’s Mercy Concealed:**

Wait until the cast finishes then sidestep the resulting protean waves. 

**Ascalon’s Might:**

Thordan will begin cleaving the target with highest enmity 3 times. *Don’t invuln this* unless you’re a warrior as you’ll need it for later in P3. Tank just needs to mitigate heavily.

**Strength of the Ward: Lightning Storm & Heavy Impact & 3x Spiral Thrust -> Ascalon’s Mercy


))))****-----&&&&& STOPPED EDITING HERE &&&&&&-------*****(((

Light parties split east/west and identify the two safe spots without a knight on either end and spread in an inverse T pattern looking in.

Once the lightning storms go off, move toward the edge and wait until the earthquake is close enough to step into. When you think you’ll be safe to step in, move directly into it while keeping an eye on the Ascalon’s Mercy cast (not left/right or you’ll end up clipping your party members). Once the cast finishes, sidestep out of the baited proteans.

### 1st Trio: Dimensional Collapse & Conviction & The Dragon’s Rage

One thing to note for this mechanic is that player placements will be Thordan relative. One method for players to determine where Thordan is is to look for the two knights in the arena that are across from each other. Thordan will always be on the opposite side of them.

Players will need to quickly identify safe spots within dimensional collapse and determine where they need to be based on their role/markers. 

* **Tanks:** Identify the placements of the 2 knights with tethers. These will always spawn opposite of Thordan. These will always tether to an unmarked player so you can wait slightly north of the knights relative to Thordan to grab your respective tether. Once obtained, move to the safe spot where Thordan is to help mitigate the shared Dragon Rage aoe, being careful not to point your cleave toward the party. Pop mitigation or invulns on the way as needed.
* **Unmarked DPS/Healers:** Identify the safe edge where Thordan is and stack tight, being careful not to steal the tether from the tanks and be positioned so you’re not getting clipped by their cleaves. This group will receive the Dragon’s Rage shared aoe and will need some mitigation and shielding to survive.
* **Marked DPS/Healers:** Go to one of the 3 leftover spots away from others and take the proximity aoe by yourself. These are completely random so it’s possible for 2 healers to get it or none at all.

Once these mechanics resolve, non-tanks go soak your respective tower since tanks will be afflicted with down for the count for 5s.

**Note:** If you choose to not have the tanks invuln this, the defamation players need to be further south in their edge away from Thordan as to not clip the tanks. Additionally, the tanks will need to cross their tethers as opposed to parallel lines. 

**Invuln Setup Example**

<p id="gdcalert17" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image17.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert18">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image59.png)

Example: Tanks grab tethers and move to where Thordan is at the edges of the dimensional collapses. Unmarked players stack up away from tanks. Marked players are by themselves at their own edges.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image21.png)

Mechanics are done, non-tanks move in to soak their Conviction towers and prepare for an Ancient Quaga raidwide.

### Ancient Quaga

Raidwide, mitigate and heal through this as needed.

### Heavenly Heel

Tankswap during the cast, player with highest enmity at the time will be afflicted with slashing vuln up then cleaved 3 times for heavy damage.

### Sanctity of the Ward & The Dragon’s Gaze/Glory

Move to an intercardinal edge opposite or next to the dark knight depending on your east/west split. The person with the 2 sword marker should be on the same intercardinal side as the dark knight add while the 1 sword marker is directly across. These are assigned randomly so adjust as needed. Once in position, look away from both the giant eye and Thordan and begin determining the rest of the mechanics.

When the paladins spawn you can look at their facings to determine the direction you’ll need to run. If they’re facing clockwise, you’ll go clockwise. If they’re facing ccw then you’ll need to move ccw.

Position yourself slightly ahead of the intercardinal edge depending on the previously mentioned paladin facings and remain on the golden edge of the arena for the remainder of this mechanic. The rest can then be resolved by waiting for the orb aoes dropped by the respective paladin dashes to blow up and stepping more than halfway into it once it disappears, making sure to hug the edge as you do so.

The dark knight will be plunging in a small shared aoe for heavy damage at the sword marked players while this is going on so either shield and mitigate when Thordan becomes untargetable or keep an eye on health.

3 and 5 splits will be fine as long as players are properly shielded and mitigation is thrown out before they move out into position. The tanks/healers in the 3 group may need to throw extra individual mitigation on squishier party members as needed.

**Note:** If you have trouble refining your movement here and gauging the distance of the orbs, you can use the notches on the side of the arena as your guide. If you start just before the 3rd notch on the intercardinal, then your next movement will be the 3rd notch at the next cardinal.

### 2nd Trio: Conviction & Hiemal Storm & Holy Comet & Heaven’s Stake

#### Part 1

4x Shiva Puddle AoEs (baited on player locations t/h or dps)

4x Fire Puddle AoEs (consistent intercard locations) 

8x Conviction Towers (random locations, 2 opposite on the edge)

2x Prey Meteor Markers (on 2 random dps or 2 random t/h)

To begin, 2 random players will be marked with prey and the group will need to identify the position of the 2 towers on the outer edge that are opposite of each other (either directly opposite or slightly askew). Players can preposition based on their assigned NESW spot between each fire puddle with their partner on the markers. The prey players will swap with the players of their role (t/h or dps) at the cardinal spots closest to these opposite towers as needed while ensuring there’s a t/h pair at each cardinal.

At the end of the Hiemal Storm cast, shiva puddles will appear under the players at their current location and players will need to move immediately out of these toward their tower soaks. Unmarked players will need to be careful not to soak the towers designated for the prey players.

**Important!** Pairs will be responsible for towers within their respective NESW quadrants. An example of this, and the checklist for determining your tower between you and your partner is shown below. Try not to overstep if possible, but there may be cursed permutations that force this.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image17.png)

Possible Tower Positions. Credit to Saeyr#0081

##### Easy Pattern (2 edge towers directly opposite at cardinal)

A method of breaking this mechanic down is in the following checklists.

1. Identify the role with the prey, and the location of the opposite towers, the players that share a role with the prey players will prioritise the other cardinal towers. *(Example Callout: tanks/healers cardinals, north/south)* 
2. 2 Towers Behind: If there are 2 towers behind you, then both you and your partner move behind once the shiva puddles drop and take the tower closest to your role’s priority. If both towers behind you are close to an intercardinal, the player with role priority moves ccw and the other moves cw. From there, the role priority player can just rotate clockwise for part 2.
3. Tower Behind, Tower in Front: In this case, if your role has prey, you move behind and your partner moves in.
4. Any other case: Call it out so people are aware of any adjustments needed.

##### **Hard Pattern** (2 edge towers 150° apart near an intercardinal)

Same as above, role with prey gets cardinal towers. Prey players will need to adjust after their trek, and quickly move into the tower opposite of their starting position on the cardinal. They may need to scoot a bit back in their initial tower position ccw to give themselves a bit more room to run if they’re given the shorter distance to run.

From here, players should be able to discern their tower positions for Part 2, leaving the initial cardinal opposites for the prey marked players.

If all towers are occupied by the end of the Conviction cast, the mechanic will continue into Part 2.

#### Part 2

7x Holy comets on the Prey marked players (consistent raidwide damage)

Faith Unmoving (knockback)

8x Conviction Towers (in each clock position)

Meteors will begin dropping on the prey marked players at the end of the Holy Comet cast; they will need to move consistently clockwise _without sprint _in a semi-circle along the edges to avoid these. These will deal raidwide damage upon landing and will detonate an existing meteor if they’re directly hit by one. Don’t worry about dropping these on other players, the raid wide damage will be consistent.

While this is happening, 8 new conviction towers will appear in clock spots along the edge and unmarked players will need to determine which one they’ll need to soak by the end of the cast. Ser Grinnaux will appear in the middle and begin casting Faith Unmoving, which can be used to get knocked into a tower from the middle or resisted using surecast/arms length. The previous lingering fire/shiva puddles will disappear slightly before the Faith Unmoving cast goes off. Players with prey will need to prepare knockback prevention around their 5th-6th meteor drop to prevent getting knocked back into the wall due to Faith Unmoving.

The 7 meteors will finish dropping a bit before the Conviction cast goes off. If every tower is soaked by this point, then the mechanic is resolved and Thordan will become targetable at North.

**Note:** Ninjas will have a bit of a tougher time keeping a consistent pace if marked with prey due to their passive bonus movement speed. Remember to take this into account when starting your trek.

#### 2nd Trio Example (Easy Pattern)

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/dsrimage3.png)

Example: Initial configuration, prey randomly assigned to both melee and opposite outer towers are north and south. So west melee and north ranged need to swap.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image28.png)

Shiva puddles are baited on either t/h or dps in these cardinal positions

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/dsrimage8.png)

Once shiva circles drop, the pairs split into their respective towers, with prey marked players having priority on the directly opposite towers.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image18.png)

Meteors begin dropping 7x on the prey marked players, these two need to move clockwise and end up on the opposite side. Prey marked players need to keep an eye on the Faith Unmoving cast and prep knockback resist as needed as they go to drop their 5th-6th meteors. Each meteor deals raidwide damage upon landing, they won’t kill others if they land on them, just make sure they don’t land on the prey target or another meteor.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image29.png)

Faith Unmoving knockback happens from the centre and puddles disappear. Either get knocked into a tower or kb resist and sit in a tower. DPS taking cardinals and t/h intercard in this example.

### Ultimate End

Heavy hitting raidwide with a long animation. Make sure players are shielded and this is mitigated heavily.

For reference, casters will be brought down to ~25k HP from full with Shields, 5 mitigations, and Tank LB1.

After this, Thordan will move inward slightly and prepare to Broad Swing.

### 2x Broad Swing

Thordan, relative to his facing cleaves 120° to either his left/right or right/left then his rear in quick succession at the end of the cast. Move from his rear to the side that was swung to first.

He will cast this twice so be prepared to reposition back to his rear after the first set.

### Aetheric Burst

Hard Enrage. Kill Thordan before this finishes, then re-center with shields and mitigations to prepare for the next phase.

# **Phase 3: Nidstinien**

The 3rd phase of this fight can be described as 90 seconds of mechanic hell with a 30 second reprieve to do as much damage as possible to meet the tight DPS check. Phases from here on in will have incredibly strict DPS checks so plan your buffs and cooldowns accordingly.

This phase may take a while for players to get in the habit of doing consistently, as many variations in *In Line _timings and _Jump* debuffs can be assigned and it may just take practice to be able to get the timings and positioning down consistently. Players will need to be hyper aware of their movement and their assigned mechanics as to not accidentally bait something incorrectly and wipe the party while maintaining uptime as they do so.

## **Phase 3 Mechanics**

### ☆ Things to Note ☆

Auto-attacks from Nidhogg will cleave in a straight line at the highest enmity target so be careful not to stand in front of him between mechanics. Each auto hits for around 20k so keep an eye on the maintank and anyone caught by any hits.

### Final Chorus

Nidhogg begins the phase from transition with heavy raidwide, becoming targetable as he lands.

### Lash and Gnash / Gnash and Lash

Lash = In, Gnash = Out. Happens ~5s after cast finishes. Getting hit will knock you back and inflict a 2 minute long damage down.

### Dive from Grace

First in Line: This person’s debuff will fall off in 10s and they will be hit with a targeted jump aoe at the end of it.

Second in Line: This person’s debuff will fall off in 20s and they will be hit with a targeted jump aoe at the end of it.

Third in Line: This person’s debuff will fall off in 30s and they will be hit with a targeted jump aoe at the end of it.

Debuffs:

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image26.png)


High Jump: Tower will spawn at the same location as the character.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image36.png)


Elusive Jump: Tower will spawn opposite the character’s facing.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/dsrimage9.png)


Spineshatter: Tower will spawn in front of the character’s facing.

Nidhogg will apply numbers from 1-3 to all players as well as one of three debuffs. Once the respective debuff next to the timer ticks down to 0, the player will be hit with a small aoe, become afflicted with a 12s fire resistance down debuff, and a 2s physical vuln up, and spawn a tower at their location. 

These towers need to be soaked by another player without a fire resistance down debuff and will additionally inflict a 12s fire resistance down debuff to the soaker. Additionally, once these towers are soaked, they will spawn a clone that needs to be baited by the soaker.

Players with First in Line will need to drop their Jump & towers away from the party, then players with Third in Line need to soak the towers left behind, then safely bait the resulting clone Geirskogul cast away from the party.

Players with Second in Line will then need to drop their Jump & towers away from the party, then two of the previous First in Line players need to soak their towers left behind, then safely bait the resulting clone Geirskogul cast away from the party.

Finally, players with Third in Line will need to drop their Jump & towers away from the party, then the remaining players without fire vulns will need to soak the last set, baiting the clones away from the party afterward.

### Eye of the Tyrant

Shared AoE baited on a random player in front of Nidhogg. Happens at the end of the Gnash and Lash / Lash and Gnash cast.

### Drachenlance

90° cleave cast baited on a random player, dodge out of it by the end of the cast to avoid getting hit.

### Darkdragon Dive

Enumeration towers. Will spawn in the intercardinal positions with the number of players needed to soak each one ranging from 1-4. The sum of all towers will always be 8.

### Soul Tethers

Tankbuster tether that attaches to a random person. Can be grabbed off of the person if intercepted. Deals heavy damage to the tethered target in a small aoe so spread away from others. Either tank invuln or kitchen sink it. 

If you used invuln during the 1st trio on Thordan, you won’t have it here.

## Phase 3 Strats

### Beginning

Between P2 and P3, top off with shields and mitigation before Nidhogg becomes targetable. One thing to note in this phase is that Nidhogg’s auto attacks will cleave in a straight line so make sure the party is away from the main tank’s facing at the beginning and between mechanics.

### Final Chorus

Heavy Raidwide from untargetable. Shield and Mitigate through this.

### Lash and Gnash / Gnash and Lash

Lash = In, Gnash = Out

Players will need to remember the order of this later as they deal with mechanics. The in/out portion of this mechanic takes place 5 seconds after the cast so don’t get baited by it.

The party will also need to stack for the following Eye of the Tyrant AoE.

### Dive from Grace aka Wyrmhole (Credit to Xeno’s group for the PoV for this strat)

There will be heavy aoe and individual damage throughout this entire mechanic so plan accordingly. Start in clock spots before markers go out; First in Line players will start to their closest east/south/west spot or an unoccupied one.

The party will group for an Eye of the Tyrant shared aoe baited in front of Nidhogg’s facing while the First in Line players place their towers at east, south, and west in max melee of the boss, resolving their debuffs if needed.

The Gnash and Lash / Lash and Gnash from earlier will then take place and Third in Line players will need to resolve the tower soaks and clone baits at the same time. The order being Gnash/Lash -> Lash/Gnash -> Tower -> Bait. Once the second part of Gnash and Lash / Lash and Gnash have finished, Second in Line players need to move NE/NW to drop their towers, resolving their debuffs if needed.

2 First in Line players will need to move out to soak the NE/NW towers and bait the clone as needed then quickly re-stack with the group. Third in Line players will move E, S and W in max melee of the boss and drop their towers. At the same time, Nidhogg will cast another Gnash and Lash / Lash and Gnash for later. Once the cast finishes, the group will be hit with another Eye of the Tyrant shared aoe so make sure people are healthy enough for this.

The remaining players without debuffs will then soak the last set of towers and baits while the Gnash and Lash / Lash and Gnash from earlier goes off in the same order of Gnash/Lash -> Lash/Gnash -> Tower -> Bait.

Once all of this is resolved, the primary enmity target will begin receiving cleaving auto attacks.

First in Line Order of Operations:

1. Place Tower
2. Back to Party
3. Dodge 
4. Soak Second in Line & Bait (if east/west)
5. Back to Party
6. Party Stack
7. Dodge 
8. Soak Third in Line & Bait (if south)

Second in Line Order of Operations:

1. Party Stack @ North
2. Dodge
3. Place Tower
4. Back to Party
5. Party Stack
6. Dodge
7. Soak Third in Line & Bait

Third in Line Order of Operations:

1. Party Stack @ North
2. Dodge
3. Soak First in Line & Bait
4. Back to Party
5. Place Tower
6. Back to Party
7. Dodge

**Dive from Grace Example**

2 of the previous First in Line players soak the Second in Line towers. Third in Line players move to their spots.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image63.png)

Bait the clones while resolving the debuffs, and dodge out of them when you see the Geirskogul cast. Nidhogg will begin casting Gnash and Lash or Lash and Gnash.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/dsrimage13.png)

Third in Line goes off while the party takes Eye of the Tyrant AoE.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/dsrimage2.png)

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image56.png)

Dodge out of Gnash while the tower soakers bait the last set of clone Geirskoguls. 

Move out when you see the cast.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image53.png)

Regroup and heal up for the next mechanic. Nidhogg will start cleaving the maintank so be careful of your movement.

### Drachenlance

Nidhogg will target a random player and begin casting a 90° cleave at their initial location. Simply move away from this before the cast ends.

### Darkdragon Dive

4 Enumeration Towers will spawn. The sum of all towers added up will equal 8 but the number inside of them will be random from 1-4. Once these towers are soaked, they will all spawn a clone. 

One method of quickly resolving the enumeration portion of this mechanic is to begin clockwise with your partner from 2nd Trio at an intercardinal tower. If your tower requires 2-4 people then stay put, if your tower only requires 1 person, then have the t/h in your pair adjust until all towers are resolved.

3 clones will cast Geirskogul, baited on the closest target. Have everyone stack east/west of Nidhogg immediately after tower soaks to bait these in a safe direction then move south once you see the Geirskogul cast.

1 clone and Nidhogg will each tether a random player. Tanks will need to grab these tethers, stand by themselves, and either invuln them or heavily mitigate them. You can have whichever tank is closest to the clone tether grab that and the other tank grab the tether from Nidhogg. If you’re more comfortable with static tethers, have the offtank stand slightly south after the baits to grab the Nidhogg tether from the party and move centre, while the main tank grabs the clone tether and moves north. 

Once this resolves, Nidhogg will continue auto attacking the maintank.

**Darkdragon Dive Example**

### Drachenlance

Same as previous, move away from the direction he’s facing before the cast is done.

### Revenge of the Horde

Hard Enrage. Kill him before the cast is finished and continue to the intermission.

# Intermission: Fang and Claw

A variation on the Fang and Claw phase from Nidhogg Extreme, players will need to kill both of Nidhogg’s eyes before the Duty Gauge reaches 100 in order to continue to the next phase. You will also need to make sure you have Limit Break 3 available before continuing on. Like Phase 3, the DPS check on this intermission phase will be tight so plan accordingly.

## Intermission Mechanics

### ☆ Things to Note ☆

## The right eye will start at 50% hp, and both eyes will continually auto-attack the highest enmity target.

### Haurchefant and Ysayle

Haurchefant will tether to a random player and Ysayle will tether to Alphinaud, each dropping a small aoe that gives you a buff if you stand in it. Players can stack both of these aoes and grab both buffs.

Haurchefant Buff: Soul of Friendship, allows you to attack the Right Eye.

Ysayle Buff: Soul of Devotion, allows you to attack the Left Eye.

### Right & Left Eye

The positions of these eyes can be flipped, spawning either east or west. Adjust your camera facing as needed so that the Left Eye is on your left and the Right Eye is on your right.

### Resentment

Raidwide with a 6s bleed.

### Hatebound

Each eye will chain to 4x random players, giving them either a red chain if attached to the Left Eye, or a blue chain if attached to the Right Eye. Players with opposite chain colours will swap colours if they touch, applying a debuff to both players preventing them from swapping again for 3s. Nothing happens if people with the same chain colour touch.

Red chained players will damage the Left Eye if they take damage from a mechanic and will be targeted with Mirage Dives later in the phase.

Blue chained players will heal the Right Eye if they take damage from a mechanic.

### Orbs

6 orbs will appear. 1 yellow orb at east and west on the edge next to the eyes, and 2 blue orbs north and south of each eye. Players will need to run into these orbs and pop them before they grow too large and detonate. Popping orbs will apply a 12s Fire Resistance Down II debuff to the player, preventing them from popping multiple orbs.

The 2 yellow orbs will start larger and pop earlier than the blue orbs and can be popped by anyone with a partner. Popping it solo otherwise will kill you.

The 4 blue orbs will start smaller and can be popped by anyone solo.

Keep in mind while popping that if you have a blue chain, popping an orb will heal the Right Eye.

### Mirage Dive

After the cast, 2 random red chained players will be hit with a small spread AoE, dealing heavy damage and afflicting them with Piercing Resistance Down for 13s, preventing them from taking consecutive hits. These dive pairs will happen 4 times, 5 seconds apart from each other.

Getting hit by a mirage dive targeting someone else will inflict heavy damage and knock you back, likely killing you as well if you have the pierce debuff.

### Steep in Rage

Heavy raidwide cast by both eyes.

## Intermission Strats

**Setup**

Establish how players will be exchanging tethers beforehand as to prevent unwanted swaps. Also determine your orb soak groups, determining which members or roles will pop each yellow/blue orb.

In this document, the melee and healers will take the 1st set of orb pops while the tanks and ranged will take the 2nd set.

**Haurchefant & Ysayle**

Haurchefant will tether a random player and Ysayle will tether Alphinaud, stack these tethers up and receive both buffs in order to be able to attack both eyes.

**Left & Right Eye Spawn**

Begin by focusing down the Right Eye, dotting both eyes if possible to assist in alleviating the dps check. Players will start in a loose spread around the Right Eye while the Left Eye tank stays put on his add.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image27.png)

Initial Positioning

**Resentment**

Raidwide with a bleed, mitigate and heal through this as needed and prepare for the chains and orbs.

**Hatebound & Orbs**

4 random players will receive red chains, while 4 random players will receive blue chains. Players in the 1st set of pops will want red chains to begin, while players in the 2nd set will want blue chains to begin. Swap chains within your respective eye groups after the 1st set has been soaked.

The Healers will take the (1st) yellow orb pops on the Left Eye while the Tanks will take the (2nd) blue orb pops.

The Melee will take the (1st) yellow orb pops on the Right Eye while the Ranged will take the (2nd) blue orb pops.

When the cast begins, start moving to the side corresponding to your group’s orb soaks but in a loose spread. Be careful not to move into anyone unnecessarily to prevent unwanted swaps.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image64.png)

Hatebound Initial Setup

If you have the correct chain colour and **are** part of the group taking the 1st orb pops, move into position.

If you have the correct chain colour and **are** **not** part of the group taking the 1st orb pops, stand off to the sides next to your Eye for the 2nd set of pops and stay still. *Do not move through the middle.*

If you don’t have the correct chain colour, move directly into the centre between the two eyes to swap then move through the middle into position.

#### Hatebound & Orbs Example

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image46.png)

Chains go out. Since both healers have blue and are 1st pop, they need to swap. Since pld & brd have red and are 2nd pop, they need to swap. Players can use this time to apply some shields and mitigations.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image58.png)

Swaps happen quickly in the middle, everyone else in position off to the side.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image45.png)

1st pop, shield and mitigate as needed.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/dsrimage6.png)

Blue chained players move at the same time through the eye to grab their red chains.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image62.png)

2nd pop, shield and mitigate as needed.

### Mirage Dive

From the orb positions before Mirage Dive, players will need to regroup around the Right Eye. Red chained players will be positioned on intercardinal spots max melee around the eye while blue chained players will be directly in its centre.

When getting into position, keep note that players with blue chains will run directly along the centre line while players with red chains will run along the outside in order to prevent premature chain passes.

At the end of the Mirage Dive cast, two random red chained players at a time will begin being targeted with Mirage Dives, 4 sets total with 5 seconds between each pair of dives. Ensure you’re a good enough distance away from each other as to not clip someone if this is you.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/dsrimage5.png)

Mirage Dive Initial Setup

The order of swaps is as follows. Healers -> Melee -> 1s Debuff players.

This means that once the 1st set of mirage dives go off, healers will swap with those respective players. Once the 2nd set of mirage dives go off, melee will swap with those respective players. Finally, once the 3rd set of mirage dives go off, the players with 1s left on their piercing debuff will swap with those respective players.

When doing your swaps, the red chained players will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stay still</span> until they can verify that someone has swapped with them. Once the swap has been verified, they can return to the centre of the eye.

#### Mirage Dive Example (Strat from Xeno’s group)

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image41.png)

1st set of Mirage Dives. Healers swap.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image43.png)

2nd set of Mirage Dives. Melee swap.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image14.png)

Third set of Mirage Dives. 1s debuff players swap (BRD & PLD in this example)

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image37.png)

Last set of Mirage Dives. Mechanic resolved.

### Steep in Rage

From here, focus down the Right Eye until it’s at 0.1% then swap over and kill the remaining eye before the Duty Gauge fills up and prepare for the Reprise.

# **Phase 4: Reprise**

The fight will begin its loop gimmick and return you to the original vault bosses in a re-imagined timeline where Haurchefant survives but this time with your 3 bars of Limit Break if you saved it. You will need to keep Haurchefant alive by the end of the Vault Boss mechanic or be looped back to P2 Thordan. The key to this phase relies on using Tank LB3 to permanently reduce the amount of damage Haurchefant takes and increase the healing he can receive throughout the mechanic.

This phase is more of a healing & DPS check than a mechanics check since it’s mostly a repeat of one mechanic from Phase 1.

## **Phase 4 Mechanics**

**Pure of Heart**

Repeat of the mechanic from the first phase. However, players will be able to enter this phase with LB3, which is a crucial component of solving the puzzle of saving Haurchefant.

Ser Grinnaux will chain everyone within a small circle, exiting this circle will kill you instantly. Meanwhile, Ser Charibert will begin casting Pure of Heart. Once his cast finishes he will deal damage to players & Haurchefant proportional to the % of his remaining health.

Two players at a time will be targeted by protean waves baited on the closest players. Players hit by the protean will later receive a 5s Skyblind debuff and drop a twister/stepped leader at their location when the timer hits 0, dealing heavy damage to those in it. These can be baited away from the initial protean position.

**Haurchefant**

Similar to the first phase, Haurchefant will block Ser Zephirin’s spear outside of the circle, receiving damage until death and creating shockwaves during each tick while alive. He will also gain an infirmity debuff which reduces his health regeneration from external sources by 100%.

Casting a Tank LB3 when he’s targetable will permanently reduce the damage he takes from the spear to one third of the original damage taken. The infirmity debuff will also be reduced from 100% to 20% allowing him to be healed more effectively throughout this mechanic. Players will need to Tank LB3 before Haurchefant begins receiving damage and keep him topped off while resolving Pure of Heart in order for him to survive through the spear damage and the Pure of Heart raidwide.

If Haurchefant is higher than 65% at the end of the raidwide, he should survive to continue on to the next DPS check.

### Spear of the Fury

Once Ser Charibert finishes his Pure of Heart cast, the spear piercing Haurchefant’s shield will become targetable. Players will need to kill this spear before the end of its cast or the fight will loop again from Thordan.

## **Phase 4 Timeline**

Times are at snapshot / end of cast unless otherwise noted

0:00	*Targetable*

0:00	**Pure of Heart Cast Starts** 

0:12	**Shockwaves Start**

0:16	**1st Brightwing** (Protean)

0:21	**2nd Brightwing & 1st Skyblind** (Protean & Stepped Leader)

0:26	**3rd Brightwing & 2nd Skyblind**

0:31 	**4th Brightwing & 3rd Skyblind**

0:35 	**Pure of Heart Cast Finishes** (Soft Enrage)

0:36 	**4th Skyblind**

0:38	**Shockwaves End** & **Spear of the Fury targetable** 

0:51	**Pierce** (Hard Enrage)

## Phase 4 Strats

### Pure of Heart

Use the same strategy your party applied during the 1st phase. However, this time shockwaves will continue all throughout the mechanic this time and persist until slightly past the end of the Pure of Heart raidwide.

Healers will need to keep players healthy throughout the mechanic and before the raidwide goes off in order to be able to make the next DPS check. As a result, the party will also need to mitigate by the end of the cast to ensure that players are still alive.

### Haurchefant

You will need to Tank LB3 when Haurchefant comes out to block the spear in order to permanently reduce the damage it deals to him per tick and to lessen the effect of the infirmity debuff on him and help to save the boy. Healers will need to keep an eye on his health and ensure that he is above 65% by the end of the Pure of Heart cast or he will die.

A good time to pop LB is after the end of the Spear of the Fury cast from Ser Zephirin has finished on the Enemy List or when you see Haurchefant’s name.

### Spear of the Fury

DPS check. Nothing else here but to kill the spear before the end of the cast. Failing to do so will restart the loop.

# Phase 5: King Thordan & Dragons

The imagining of a scenario where Haurchefant survived will bring you to face King Thordan alongside his Knights of the Round, and children of both Nidhogg’s and Hraesvelgr’s broods in this phase.

This phase features 2 major trio mechanics in Wrath of the Heavens and Death of the Heavens during which Thordan is untargetable, along with a soft enrage DPS check.

## Phase 5: Mechanics

**Incarnation**

Thordan gains control of three dragons of Nidhogg’s and Hraesvelger’s broods; Darkscale, Vedrfolnir, and Vidofnir. Has no effect other than for cinematic purposes.

**The Dragon’s Eye**

Thordan gains the power of a dragon’s eye. Has no effect other than for cinematic purposes.

**Wrath of the Heavens (1st Trio)**

A jumble of mechanics, featuring mechanics from earlier phases and those seen in UCoB.

The order of major mechanics is as follows: 

Chain Lightning

Twisting Dive

Ascalon’s Mercy Revealed

Liquid Heaven

Altar Flare

Cauterize

Lightning Storm

Empty Dimension

**Chain Lightning**

During the initial positioning for Wrath of the Heavens, 2 players will be hit with Chain Lightning, afflicting them with a Thunderstruck debuff for 15s. These players will be hit with a lightning storm AoE once this debuff falls off.

**Twisting Dive**

Similar to how Twisters worked in UCoB. At the end of the cast, every player drops a twister at their location. Players that step on a twister will deal damage to everyone nearby and knock them back.

**Ascalon’s Mercy Revealed**

Protean spread. Players will be hit with a small cone originating from King Thordan at the end of the cast. Applies a Physical Vulnerability Up upon being hit, preventing you from being hit by more than one.

**Liquid Heaven**

Similar to Liquid Hells on UCoB, Vedrfolnir shoots 5 puddles sequentially at a random player, dealing damage with each hit. Anyone that touches these puddles is killed instantly. 

If you’re the targeted player, make sure you drop these away from Grinnaux’s location and that you’re not snapshotted by the puddles as they get placed.

**Altar Flare**

4 eruptions baited underneath one of the players previously targeted with Spiral Pierce (? not sure this is correct yet but I haven’t seen indicators showing otherwise). These begin erupting in the order that they were dropped after the end of Ser Charibert’s cast.

**Cauterize**

Wide line AoE/Divebomb from Darkscale/Vidofnir. The direction of the divebombs for the first Trio are baited by the random player with a green marker above their heads and the direction is snapshotted once the marker disappears.

Image of Darkscale added below in case you need help identifying him for 2nd Trio, but he’s the only dark dragon of the three so it shouldn’t be difficult to point him out.

![](/img/encounters/ultimate/image52.png)

Darkscale

**Empty Dimension**

Same as from P1. Donut AoE originating from Ser Grinnaux at the end of his cast, those hit will be knocked back and damaged heavily.

**Ancient Quaga**

Heavy raidwide. Mitigate and shield as needed.

### Heavenly Heel

Tankswap at cast. Player with highest enmity receives a slashing resist down debuff then Thordan cleaves 3 times at the highest enmity target with Ascalon’s Might.

**Ascalon’s Might**

3 consecutive tankbuster cleaves at the highest enmity target. Mitigate as needed.

**Death of the Heavens (2nd Trio** AKA Playstation 2**)**

An even meaner jumble of mechanics that also features mechanics from earlier in the fight and from UCoB.

The order of major mechanics is as follows: 

Doom Applied

Heavy Impact

Lightning Storm & Twisting Dive & Cauterize & Wings of Salvation & Spear of the Fury

The Dragon’s Gaze/Glory

Faith Unmoving

Heaven’s Flame

Holy Meteor

#### Heavy Impact

Ser Gerrique casts an earthquake with expanding rings, dodge into the aoes as they appear. Getting hit by an earthquake will stun you.

**Doom**

Similar to the Nael mechanic in UCoB, 4 players will be afflicted with a Doom lasting 25s. If this debuff wears off without being cleansed, the afflicted player is instantly killed. This debuff can be cleansed by stepping into a small circle left by a light puddle dropped after Wings of Salvation.

This cannot target 4 of each role, meaning all of t/h or dps cannot get this at the same time.

**Wings of Salvation**

Vidofnir casts Wings of Salvation, dropping 4 light puddles underneath players not afflicted with doom at the end of the cast. When these puddles disappear, they will leave a small circle that can be used to cleanse the doom debuff. Additionally, any players within the light puddles at the moment they disappear will be killed.

#### Lightning Storm

Every player is hit with a spread AoE, applying a Lightning Resistance Down II debuff for 3s. These will kill any player that overlaps them.

**Spear of the Fury**

Two line AoEs originating from knights at the edge of the arena. They will always spawn slightly intercardinal and the resulting AoEs will form an X.

**The Dragon’s Gaze/Glory**

Gaze attack originating from both a giant eye and Thordan at the edge of the arena, players will need to be looking away from both at the cast or be afflicted by Hysteria.

### Faith Unmoving

Ser Grinnaux knocks back all players relative to his location.

**Heavensflame**

Similar to the mechanic seen in Phase 1.

4 pairs of symbols will appear on 8 random players. These indicate the player pairs that will be chained soon after. These chains need to be broken immediately by distance or both chained players will begin receiving heavy damage.

Soon after, every player will be hit with individual circular aoes that deal heavy damage, and afflicting them with a magic vuln up. These will kill others if they overlap.

Doomed Players will get: **2** **circles**, **1 triangle**, and **1 square**.

Non-Doomed Players will get: **2** **crosses**, **1 triangle**, and **1 square**.

**Holy Meteors**

8 targetable Meteor Circles will spawn in each clock position. All meteors will need to be killed within 15s or the party will be wiped.

Each meteor has ~116k HP.

**Aetheric Burst**

Hard Enrage. Kill him before the cast is finished to continue to the next phase.

# Phase 6: Nidhogg & Hraesvelgr

This phase will have you fighting an enslaved Hraesvelgr and Nidhogg at the same time.

What’s written here is speculation based on what’s seen in the current povs until we learn more and is subject to change.

## Phase 6: Mechanics

**Dread Wyrmsbreath**

3 non-tank players will receive proximity tethers from Nidhogg. Tethered players will be hit with a Flame Breath at the end of the cast while Nidhogg’s highest enmity target will be hit with a Dark Breath.

**Dark Breath**

AoE on the player with highest enmity on Nidhogg, applies a Dark Orb debuff on those that are hit.

**Flame Breath**

Players tethered to Nidhogg will be hit with a Flame Breath conal AoE at the end of the cast. Players hit with this cone will be afflicted with Boiling, a Fire Resistance Down II debuff, and a Physical Vuln Up debuff.

Boiling: Body is slowly heating up. Will become Pyretic when this effect expires.

Pyretic: Fire-aspected damage is taken with every action.

**Great Wyrmsbreath**

3 non-tank players will receive proximity tethers from Hraesvelgr. Tethered players will be hit with an Ice Breath at the end of the cast while Hraesvelgr’s highest enmity target will be hit with a Holy Breath. 

**Holy Breath**

AoE on the player with highest enmity on Hraesvelgr, applies a Holy Orb debuff on those that are hit.

**Ice Breath**

Players tethered to Hraesvelgr will be hit with an Ice Breath conal AoE at the end of the cast. Players hit with this cone will be afflicted with Freezing, an Ice Resistance Down II debuff, and a Physical Vuln Up debuff.

Freezing: Your body is slowly turning into ice. Will experience a Deep Freeze when this effect expires.

Deep Freeze: Frozen solid and unable to execute actions.

**Akh Afah**

Shared AoE (?)

**Mortal Vow**

Debuff. 

*Condemned by Nidhogg’s vow to avenge his brood-sister. Healing potency is decreased. Taking damage overtime, and will inflict anguish on those nearby in turn when this effect expires.*

**Solemn Vow**

*Recognized under the oath Hraesvelgr swore to his beloved Shiva – that he would never kill her kin.*

Damage buff for Hraesvelgr that happens whenever any player dies through one of his attacks (?)

**Cauterize**

Nidhogg will reappear at one half of the arena and begin casting Cauterize. At the end of the cast he will divebomb through the side of the arena he’s on.

**Hallowed Wings**

Similar to the mechanic in E8S. One of Hraesvelgr’s wings will glow indicating the side of the arena he will cleave.

**Hallowed Plume**

2 players will be randomly targeted with a large AoE. Cannot stack these (?) 

**Akh Morn**

**Hot Tail**

**Hot Wing**
