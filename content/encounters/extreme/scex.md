# Storm's Crown (Extreme) Introduction

The Storm's Crown (Extreme is an 8-man encounter released with Patch 6.2, Buried Memories. This fight requires a minimum item level of 600, but this requirement may be bypassed with a preformed party. To unlock the Extreme version of this fight, a player must have completed the Normal mode, unlocked through the MSQ, then talk to the Wandering Minstrel in Old Sharlayan (X: 12.6, Y: 14.2). This Trial drops weapons with an item level of 615 and a chance to drop the following: Faded Copy of Battle with the Four Winds Orchestration Roll, a Lynx of Imperious Wind Flute, and the Pearl of the Winds crafting material.

## Party Setup

Before the fight even begins, the party will want to choose clock positions for mechanics further in the fight. It is suggested to place tanks and healers on the cardinal positions (North, East, South, and West) while placing DPS on the intercardinals (North-East, South-East, South-West, North-West). Once that's been sorted out, the group should then split into light parties, or two groups of four players. Simply place one tank, one healer, and two DPS in each group.

## Mechanic Descriptions 

The mechanics will be listed in the order that they appear:

**Void Aero IV** - Moderate raid wide damage on all party members.

**Savage Barbery** - A two part mechanic. Combines either an in/out AoE with Barbariccia throwing her sword to the edge of the arena.

**Hair Raid** - A two part mechanic. Combines either a light party stack or a spread with one of two AoE combinations; a cone AoE from the wall, or a donut AoE under the boss.

**Void Aero III** - A tank buster that places a vuln up on the tank who takes damage.

**Upbraid** - A stack requiring a specific amount of people inside of it. For this fight, the stack requires two players inside when the damage resolves.

**Secret Breeze** - Conal AoE that can be dodged.

**Teasing Tangle** - All eight players are separated into groups of two and slowed by the pillar of hair within their circle. Each pair will receive either a large AoE and an Upbraid, or a large AoE and no debuff. The boss will cleave the hair towers with Secret Breeze, followed by conal AoEs placed on all eight players which places a magic vulnerability up on all players.

**Swirly** - Creates a swirling AoE on the arena. (Needs real name)

**Blow Away** - Minor raid wide damage, initiates the start of several ground AoEs being placed on players.
