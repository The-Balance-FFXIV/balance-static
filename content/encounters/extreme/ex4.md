## Mechanics

All players require clock positions for spreads, with tanks north and south, healers east and west, and DPS on intercardinals. Additionally, split the party into two light parties with one tank, one healer, and two DPS in each.

During the Wind Phase, the outside of the arena will be engulfed in a storm. Players who move into it will receive a windburn DoT.

### Normal Phase

**Void Aero IV**\
Moderate raid-wide magical damage.

**Raging Storm**\
Barbariccia jumps to the middle of the arena, dealing light raid-wide magical damage.

**Savage Barbery**\
Barbariccia begins to throw her sword, doing a large AoE at a random cardinal. She also does a mechanic beforehand based on how she is holding her sword.

* If the sword is held up, the mechanic is a line AoE through the front and back of her hitbox.
* If the sword is held down, the mechanic is a donut AoE around her.

**Hair Raid**\
Barbariccia tethers to the sword once it's thrown and does another mechanic based on how she is standing.

* If she is raised in the air, she will do a donut AoE around her.
* If she is crouched down, she will jump to the sword and do a cone AoE toward the inside of the arena.

**Deadly Twist**\
Two stack markers appear on healers.

**Hair Spray**\
AoE markers appear on all players.

**Void Aero III**\
A magical tank buster on the main tank that inflicts a Wind Resistance Down debuff. This forces a tank swap.

**Teasing Tangles**\
Barbariccia will fetter all players and tether one support and one DPS to four tangle circles that appear at cardinals. This tether will decrease player movement speed, and players cannot leave their tether or else they will be forcibly dragged back in the middle and take a DoT.

**Secret Breeze**\
A cone AoE toward all four cardinals. After the first hit, all players are targeted with an invisible physical cone AoE that inflicts a physical vulnerability debuff.

**Hair Flay**\
A large AoE marker appears on one player from each tangle.

**Upbraid**\
A two-player stack marker.

**Curling Iron**\
The transition to the wind phase. Players in the middle will be knocked out of her hitbox by Voidstrom, and both attacks do light magical damage.

**Entanglement**\
Starting from the second normal phase, Barbariccia will tether players together in tangles. This works the same way as Teasing Tangles: players cannot leave the circle and their movement speed is reduced. Players with the same Playstation mark above their head are tethered together.

**Catabasis**\
Barbariccia's ultimate attack, dealing massive raid-wide magical damage.

### Wind Phase

**Brutal Rush**\
Barbariccia tethers to four players of one role. She will jump to them, deal light damage, and quickly fire a line AoE at them.

**Winding Gale**\
Curved and straight line AoEs that collide in the center.

**Boulder Break**\
A magical tank buster on the main tank that should be shared by both tanks or invulned.

**Brittle Boulder**\
Barbariccia marks all players with a rock. This indicates that a large AoE will appear on the ground underneath them when the marker disappears. Afterward, AoE markers appear on all players.

**Tornado Chain**\
Three sets of ring AoEs that spawn from the middle and fan out.

**Knuckle Drum**\
A multi-hit, raid-wide attack that deals ten hits of light magical damage and finishes with one hit of moderate magical damage.

**Blow Away**\
Small AoEs appear on the ground underneath four players.

**Bold Boulder**\
Proximity tank busters on both tanks.

**Impact**\
An instant death AoE from the middle of the room that knocks all players back from the center.

**Trample**\
A random healer is targeted with a physical stack marker.

**Blustery Ruler**\
A circular AoE in the center. Small tornadoes will fan out from this AoE, which are essentially AoEs that need to be dodged.

**Dry Blows**\
Small ground AoEs randomly appear on the arena.

**Iron Out**\
The transition to the normal phase. Players in the middle will be knocked out of her hitbox by Voidstrom, and both attacks do light magical damage.

## Fight Strategy

**Phase One**

* There is lots of AoE chip damage in this fight from raid-wides such as Void Aero IV, Raging Storm, and Knuckle Drum.
* Barbariccia begins by casting one version of Savage Barbery. Either stand to her side away from the sword if she is holding it up, or inside her hitbox away from the sword if she is holding it down.
* Right afterward, she will begin to cast Hair Raid along with a spread or stack. Either stay inside her hitbox if she is in the air, or run to the wall where the sword is at if she is crouched down. Afterward, resolve the spread or stack mechanic.
* She then does the other version of the mechanic that was not done previously with Savage Barbery, Hair Raid, and stack or spread.
* After the second set of mechanics, Barbariccia will do a raid-wide into a tank buster. The off tank (OT) will need to provoke the boss during the cast bar of Void Aero III.
* All players get fettered and tethered to a tangle. Players are not allowed to leave their tangle.
* Four players will receive Hair Flay, two players will receive Upbraid, and two players will receive no mechanic. Have players with Upbraid and players with no mechanic move toward each other on one side of the Secret Breeze cone to stack together, while players with the large AoE move away on the other side to avoid clipping them. After stacking, spread slightly to avoid clipping each other with the protean from Secret Breeze.
* Return to the middle and heal up for the instances of raid-wide damage.
* After Barbariccia disappears, stack up and heavily mitigate for Catabasis.

**Phase Two**

* Tanks and healers should head to their clock spots to make baiting and moving for Brutal Rush easier.
* Afterwards, the OT should move north to stack with the main tank (MT) for Boulder Break.
* Dodge Winding Gale while doing so.
* After the curved AoEs are gone, stack in the middle (it's safe!) to bait Brittle Boulder AoEs.
* After the AoE appears, move out to clock positions to spread from the AoE markers.
* Supports are targeted with Upbraid here. DPS should rotate clockwise to stack with a partner. Dodge Tornado Chain while doing so.
* DPS should head to their clock spots to make baiting and moving for Brutal Rush easier.
* Afterward, as Barbariccia faces south, players stack north to mitigate and heal through Knuckle Drum. This ensures all players can bait the next mechanic properly.
* Blow Away and Brutal Rush will be cast. For this version, all players should move together clockwise to bait both mechanics.
* The party should end up south and stay south for Trample. Tanks should go back north away from each other to take Bold Boulder away from the party. Either use knockback prevention or stay close to the middle of the arena to not get knocked back into the wall.
* DPS should head to their clock spots to make baiting and moving for Brutal Rush easier. Keep in mind that the first two hits will likely be on the party, as everyone is stacked there.
* Barbariccia will tangle players again with Teasing Tangles. She then casts a combination of Blustery Ruler, Dry Blows, and Tornado Chain. Players will have to dodge the tornadoes fanning out from the center, the AoEs on the ground, and the ring AoEs.
* One player from each stack should go left and one player should go right. This will ensure players can stack with each other for Upbraid, which is cast on four players. Dodge Secret Breeze afterward.
* Return to the middle to heal and mitigate the AoEs that come as she transitions back to the normal phase.

**Phase Three**

* Barbariccia will jump to the middle of the arena with Raging Storm.
* She casts Entanglement, tethering one DPS to one support each. Each pair should stand in one intercardinal.
* Stay at the intercardinal to dodge Secret Breeze, then move apart to dodge the player-based cone AoE.
* She casts a random version of Savage Barbery, Hair Raid, and spread / stack.
* This is followed by a raid-wide into a Void Aero III that necessitates a tank swap.
* Another Raging Storm is followed by a second Entanglement.
* This Entanglement will have two pairs targeted with Upbraid instead. Have the players targeted stand still and the unmarked pairs move to one marked pair each. Have one player inside each stack while still inside their circle.
* The other version of Savage Barbery, Hair Raid, and stack / spread that was not cast yet in this phase is performed next.
* Return to the middle and heal and mitigate for the raid-wide and transition to another wind phase.

**Phase Four**

* Tanks and healers should head to their clock spots to make baiting and moving for Brutal Rush easier.
* Afterward, stack north for Knuckle Drum and to begin baits for Blow Away.
* Move clockwise around the boss to bait the AoEs. After this Blow Away, all players are targeted with Brittle Boulder, so after the fourth set of AoEs move to the center of the arena, then head to clock spots after AoEs are baited.
* Right as the marked AoEs come out, DPS are targeted with Brutal Rush, so they need to dodge while not clipping other players with their AoE.
* Barbariccia then casts multiple combinations of AoE moves.
* She begins with Tornado Chain, Impact, and Hair Spray. Players need to dodge the rings and then stay in their clock spots. Use knockback prevention or get knocked back properly and stay spread for the AoEs.
* Next, Brutal Rush is cast on supports.
* Afterward, players need to dodge Blustery Ruler tornadoes and Dry Blows AoEs.
* The OT should move north to stack with the MT for Boulder Break. Do this while dodging the AoEs and Winding Gale.
* Tornado Chain is accompanied with the line AoEs from Winding Gale. Have the party stay south and the tanks go north.
* This is because tanks will receive proximity busters and a random healer will get Trample, the stack marker. There is no knockback during this part.
* Stack together to mitigate for Knuckle Drum as well as the transition back into the final normal phase of the fight.

**Phase Five**

* The final phase is all previously seen mechanics.
* She does Entanglement into Secret Breeze, so head to intercardinals and spread after while staying inside the circle.
* She then does a random Savage Barbery, Hair Raid, and spread / stack set.
* After a raid-wide, she will begin to cast Maelstrom, the enrage. Kill the boss before she kills you!

### Party Finder Strategies

* TN and Boss Relative refer to how players spread for clock spot mechanics for Hair Spray and Brittle Boulder.
* Enumeration 1/3 refers to Upbraid: players with Upbraid or no marker head closer to the 1 and 3 markers.
* Mario Kart N refers to Blow Away baits. Players will start north and head clockwise to bait these AoEs.
* DPS CW refers to how DPS move clockwise to stack for Upbraid.
* Playstation colors refers to Entanglement: pairs will head to their respective colors indicated by the intercardinal markers on the arena.
