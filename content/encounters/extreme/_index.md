## Mechanics

All players require clock positions for spreads, with tanks north and south, healers east and west, and DPS on intercardinals. Additionally, split the party into two light parties of one tank, one healer, and two DPS each.

### Phase One

Moderate raidwide magical damage.

**Raging Storm**  
Barbariccia jumps to the middle of the arena, dealing light raidwide magical damage.

**Savage Barbery**  
Barbariccia begins to throw her sword doing a large AoE at a random cardinal. She does a mechanic beforehand based on how she is holding it.
* If the sword is held up, it is a line AoE front and behind her in her hitbox.
* If the sword is held down, it is a donut AoE around her.

**Hair Raid**  
Barbariccia tethers to the sword thrown previously and does a mechanic based on how she is standing.
* If she is raised in the air, she will do a donut AoE around her.
* If she is crouched down, she will jump to the sword and do a conal AoE towards the inside of the arena.

**Deadly Twist**  
Two stack markers appear on healers.

**Hair Spray**  
AoE markers appear on all players.
