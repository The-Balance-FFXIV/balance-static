## Mechanics

All players require clock positions for spreads, with tanks north and south, healers east and west, and DPS on intercardinals. Additionally, split the party into two light parties of one tank, one healer, and two DPS each.

### Normal Phase

**Void Aero IV**  
Moderate raidwide magical damage.

**Raging Storm**  
Barbariccia jumps to the middle of the arena, dealing light raidwide magical damage.

**Savage Barbery**  
Barbariccia begins to throw her sword doing a large AoE at a random cardinal. She does a mechanic beforehand based on how she is holding it.
* If the sword is held up, it is a line AoE front and behind her in her hitbox.
* If the sword is held down, it is a donut AoE around her.

**Hair Raid**  
Barbariccia tethers to the sword thrown previously and does a mechanic based on how she is standing.
* If she is raised in the air, she will do a donut AoE around her.
* If she is crouched down, she will jump to the sword and do a conal AoE towards the inside of the arena.

**Deadly Twist**  
Two stack markers appear on healers.

**Hair Spray**  
AoE markers appear on all players.

**Void Aero III**  
A magical tank buster on the main tank that inflicts a Wind Resistance Down debuff. This forces a tank swap.

**Teasing Tangles**  
Barbariccia will fetter all players and tether one support and one DPS to four tangle circles that appear at cardinals. This tether will decrease player movement speed, and players cannot leave their tether or else they will be forcibly dragged back in the middle and take a DoT.

**Secret Breeze**  
A conal AoE towards all four cardinals. After the first hit, all players are targeted with an invisible physical conal AoE that inflicts a physical vuln debuff.

**Hair Flay**  
A large AoE marker appears on one player from each tangle.

**Upbraid**  
A two-player stack marker.

**Curling Iron**  
The transition to the wind phase. Players in the middle will be knocked out of her hitbox by Voidstrom, and both attacks do light magical damage.

**Entanglement**  
Starting from the second normal phase, Barbariccia will tether players together in tangles. This works the same way as Teasing Tangles - players cannot leave the circle, and their movement speed is reduced.

**Catabasis**  
Barbariccia's ultimate attack, dealing massive raidwide magical damage.

### Wind Phase

**Brutal Rush**  
Barbariccia tethers to four players of one role. She will jump to them, dealing light damage, and fire a line AoE quickly at them.

**Winding Gale**  
Curved and straight line AoEs that collide in the centre.

**Boulder Break**  
A magical tank buster on the main tank that should be shared by both tanks or invulned.

**Brittle Boulder**  
Barbariccia marks all players with a rock. This indicates that a large AoE will appear on the ground underneath them when the marker disappears. Afterwards, AoE markers appear on all players.

**Tornado Chain**  
Three sets of ring AoEs that spawn from the middle from the middle and fan out.

**Knuckle Drum**  
A multi-hit raidwide magic damage that deals ten hits of light raidwide magical damage into one hit of moderate raidwide magical damage.

**Blow Away**  
Small AoEs appear on the ground underneath four players.

**Bold Boulder**  
Proximity tank busters on both tanks.

**Impact**  
An instant death AoE from the middle of the room that knocks all players back from the centre.

**Trample**  
A random healer is targeted with a physical stack marker.

**Blustery Ruler**  
A circular AoE in the centre. Small tornadoes will fan out from this AoE, which are essentially AoEs that need to be dodged.

**Dry Blows**  
Small ground AoEs randomly appear on the arena.

**Iron Out**  
The transition to the normal phase. Players in the middle will be knocked out of her hitbox by Voidstrom, and both attacks do light magical damage.
